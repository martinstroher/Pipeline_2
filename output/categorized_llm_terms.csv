Term,Category,Reasoning,NLD
dolomite,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'sedimentary carbonate rock', which is a direct match to this category's definition.","Dolomite is a sedimentary carbonate rock that is composed predominantly of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO₃)₂. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is a diagenetic product that typically forms through the replacement of precursor calcite and aragonite in microbialite or coquina facies. This dolomitization process is a critical control on reservoir quality, capable of creating, enhancing, or occluding the pore system."
fault,Geological Structure,"The NLD defines a fault as a 'structural discontinuity,' which directly aligns with the GeoCore definition of Geological Structure as the internal arrangement of a Geological Object, and 'fault' is explicitly listed as an example for this category.","A fault is a structural discontinuity that exhibits shear displacement between adjacent rock blocks. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these are predominantly basement-involved normal faults that define the rift-related horst and graben architecture. This framework is critical as it creates both the structural traps for hydrocarbon accumulation and the primary conduits for migration from source to reservoir."
rift,Geological Object,"The NLD defines a rift as a 'tectonic basin,' which is a large-scale, identifiable entity formed by a geological process (extension), fitting the definition of a Geological Object.","A rift is an elongate tectonic basin that is formed by continental lithospheric extension and bounded by high-angle normal faults. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt province, this Early Cretaceous tectonic event created the fundamental basin architecture of horsts and grabens, which controlled the deposition of lacustrine source rocks in the lows. The inherited rift topography subsequently focused the accumulation of the overlying sag-phase carbonate reservoirs on structural highs prior to the deposition of the regional salt seal."
aptian,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'chronostratigraphic stage' and an 'interval' during which geological processes, such as deposition, occurred.","The Aptian is a chronostratigraphic stage of the Early Cretaceous that, in the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, encompasses the deposition of the main lacustrine carbonate reservoirs of the sag phase. This interval is characterized by the development of extensive microbialite and coquina facies within a restricted continental setting. It is immediately overlain by the thick evaporitic sequence that forms the regional seal of the petroleum system."
reservoir,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines a reservoir as a 'subsurface rock body' and provides examples of its constitution ('microbial carbonates'), which are types of sedimentary rock.","A reservoir is a subsurface rock body that possesses a connected pore system capable of storing and transmitting economically significant volumes of hydrocarbons within a geological trap. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt province, these are predominantly Aptian microbial carbonates and spherulites sealed by a thick evaporitic sequence. This specific configuration forms traps for vast accumulations of light oil and associated gas."
sediment,Sediment,"The NLD defines the term as a 'naturally occurring unconsolidated material that consists of an accumulation of discrete particles', which directly matches the GeoReservoir definition of Sediment.","A sediment is a naturally occurring unconsolidated material that consists of an accumulation of discrete particles generated by biological, chemical, or physical weathering processes. Within the sag-phase lacustrine systems of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this material is primarily composed of intrabasinal carbonates, such as microbial precipitates and bioclastic fragments, which form the precursor to reservoir facies. The character and distribution of these sediments fundamentally control the initial properties of the subsequent source, reservoir, and seal rocks of the petroleum system."
unconformity,Geological Boundary,"The NLD defines an unconformity as a 'stratigraphic surface of erosion or non-deposition that separates' rock bodies, which fits the definition of a physical discontinuity on the external surface of a Geological Object.","An unconformity is a stratigraphic surface of erosion or non-deposition that separates older rocks from significantly younger, overlying strata, representing a major hiatus in the geological record. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, the pre-Aptian unconformity is a critical element formed by prolonged subaerial exposure of the lacustrine carbonate reservoirs. This exposure event created extensive karst systems that dramatically enhanced reservoir quality immediately below the regional salt seal."
carbonate,Sedimentary Rock,The NLD explicitly defines a carbonate as a type of sedimentary rock composed of carbonate minerals.,"A carbonate is a sedimentary rock that is primarily composed of minerals containing the carbonate anion (CO₃²⁻) and, within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, originates from abiogenic, microbial, and bioclastic precipitation in a saline, alkaline lacustrine rift system. Its complex depositional textures and subsequent diagenesis, including widespread dissolution, create the highly porous and permeable intervals that form the main reservoirs of this petroleum system."
porosity,quality,"The NLD explicitly defines porosity as a 'fundamental petrophysical property of a reservoir rock' that quantifies the void space, which directly aligns with the BFO definition of a quality.","Porosity is a fundamental petrophysical property of a reservoir rock that quantifies the fraction of the total rock volume occupied by void spaces, known as pores. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, this pore system comprises a complex network of interparticle, intraparticle, vuggy, and moldic voids that provides the storage capacity for hydrocarbons. The effective porosity, which represents the interconnected pore volume, is a critical parameter for estimating reserves and predicting reservoir performance."
evaporite,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'chemical sedimentary rock', which directly aligns with the Sedimentary Rock category.","An evaporite is a chemical sedimentary rock that is formed by the precipitation of mineral salts from a concentrated aqueous solution resulting from evaporation. In the context of the South Atlantic marginal basins, this rock type is predominantly composed of Aptian-age halite which forms the regional top seal for the Pre-Salt petroleum systems. Its extremely low permeability and ductile rheology are critical for hydrocarbon entrapment and the development of halokinetic structures."
fracture,Geological Boundary,"The NLD defines a fracture as a 'planar or curviplanar mechanical discontinuity' within a rock mass, which directly aligns with the concept of a Geological Boundary as a physical discontinuity.","A fracture is a planar or curviplanar mechanical discontinuity that results from stress-induced failure within a rock mass, and which critically enhances or compartmentalizes the reservoir by forming secondary porosity-permeability networks in Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates."
grainstone,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines grainstone as a 'grain-supported carbonate rock' constituted by grains, which directly matches the definition of a Sedimentary Rock.","A grainstone is a grain-supported carbonate rock that is free of mud and whose original interparticle pore space is occluded by cement. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these rocks are typically composed of non-skeletal grains, such as spherulites and ooids, deposited in high-energy lacustrine shoal environments. Due to their high primary porosity and permeability, these facies constitute the most prolific petroleum reservoirs in the province."
permeable,quality,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a quality of a reservoir rock that describes its capacity to transmit fluids, which aligns with the BFO definition of a quality inhering in an independent continuant.","Permeable is a quality of a reservoir rock that describes its capacity to transmit fluids, which is governed by the connectivity of its pore system. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this quality is highly heterogeneous within microbial and spherulitic carbonates, where effective fluid flow is critically dependent on the interconnection of vuggy, interparticle, and fracture porosity. This property is the primary control on the producibility of a reservoir and its ability to deliver hydrocarbons to a wellbore at economic rates."
reservoir quality,quality,"The NLD defines the term as a 'collective measure of a rock's petrophysical properties,' which is a quality that inheres in a bearer (the rock).","Reservoir quality is a collective measure of a rock's petrophysical properties, primarily porosity and permeability, that governs its capacity to store and effectively transmit hydrocarbons. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine carbonates, this measure is fundamentally controlled by the complex interplay between original depositional facies and subsequent diagenetic overprinting. This interaction ultimately determines the final pore system's geometry, connectivity, and producibility."
depositional environment,Geological Process,"The NLD defines it as a system governed by physical, chemical, and biological processes that result in the accumulation of sediments, which aligns with the definition of a Geological Process.","A depositional environment is a natural system that is defined by the specific physical, chemical, and biological processes governing the accumulation and character of sediments. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this refers to the sag-phase lacustrine settings where unique water chemistry and microbial activity controlled the genesis and architecture of widespread carbonate reservoirs and organic-rich source rocks. The resulting facies architecture is a direct product of the energy, water depth, and chemical conditions that defined this setting."
structural high,Geological Structure,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'positive geological structure' which represents the arrangement of an uplifted crustal block.,"A structural high is a positive geological structure that, in the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, represents an uplifted crustal block formed during the syn-rift phase. This elevated paleotopography controlled the deposition of lacustrine carbonate reservoirs and forms the primary trapping geometry for hydrocarbons. These traps are sourced from adjacent grabens and are effectively sealed by the regional Aptian evaporitic sequence."
spherulite,Geological Object,"The NLD defines a spherulite as a discrete 'carbonate grain' composed of crystals, which fits the definition of a rigid entity with its own identity and unity criteria, analogous to a crystal or nodule.","A spherulite is a non-skeletal carbonate grain that is composed of radially arranged, acicular to fibrous calcite crystals. It forms as a primary chemical or microbially-mediated precipitate within the high-alkalinity lacustrine depositional systems characteristic of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. These grains are a fundamental constituent of the most significant reservoir facies in this petroleum province."
dissolution,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines dissolution as a 'diagenetic process' that chemically modifies a rock, which directly corresponds to the definition of a Geological Process.","Dissolution is a diagenetic process that creates or enhances secondary porosity through the chemical removal of mineral matter by an undersaturated fluid. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is predominantly driven by the interaction of CO₂-rich fluids with microbial carbonate facies. The resulting vuggy and cavernous porosity is a fundamental control on the productivity of these reservoirs."
calcite,Earth Material,"The NLD defines calcite as a rock-forming mineral and a principal constituent of reservoir facies, which aligns with the definition of Earth Material as a natural amount of matter that constitutes geological objects.","Calcite is a rock-forming carbonate mineral with the chemical formula CaCO₃ that is the principal constituent of the main Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoir facies, including microbialites, spherulites, and coquinas. Diagenetically, it occurs as a pore-occluding cement that significantly reduces reservoir quality or as a neomorphic product from the stabilization of aragonite. It is the most geologically stable polymorph of calcium carbonate under the burial conditions of the Pre-Salt."
lacustrine environment,site,"The NLD defines this as a 'depositional setting' and the 'conditions within a lake basin,' which corresponds to a three-dimensional immaterial entity whose boundaries are determined by material entities.","A lacustrine environment is a continental depositional setting that is characterized by the physical, chemical, and biological conditions within a lake basin. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt sag phase, this environment is defined by large, long-lived lakes formed in a rift setting. Its typically saline and alkaline water chemistry controlled the coeval deposition of prolific microbial carbonate reservoirs and organic-rich source rocks."
mudstone,Sedimentary Rock,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'carbonate rock' composed of sedimentary particles like carbonate mud and grains.,"A mudstone is a mud-supported carbonate rock that, according to the Dunham classification, contains less than 10 percent grains. Composed predominantly of carbonate mud (micrite), it is characterized by very low primary porosity and permeability. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this lithofacies frequently forms seals or baffles that compartmentalize the main microbialite and coquina reservoir intervals."
rift phase,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD defines the term as a 'tectonic phase' and an 'initial stage' that precedes other events, which corresponds to a temporal region occupied by geological processes.","A rift phase is a tectonic phase that marks the initial stage of continental break-up, characterized by crustal extension that forms a series of half-grabens. Within the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these basins accumulate the critical lacustrine source rocks and coquina reservoirs of the petroleum system. This phase precedes the deposition of the sag section and the regional salt seal."
seismic facies,Facies,"The NLD defines a seismic facies as a unit characterized by a distinct set of reflection parameters, which aligns with the definition of Facies as a visual pattern of properties of Geological Objects.","A seismic facies is a mappable, three-dimensional seismic unit that is characterized by a distinct set of reflection parameters, including internal configuration, continuity, amplitude, and frequency. This interpretive unit is inferred to correspond to a specific depositional system or lithofacies association, which is critical for differentiating the complex carbonate reservoir bodies of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its analysis enables the prediction of key reservoir facies, such as microbialites and coquinas, and their distinction from surrounding lacustrine source rocks and volcanic intrusions."
diagenesis,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'sum of all physical, chemical, and biological processes that alter a sediment', which directly matches the definition of a Geological Process.","Diagenesis is the sum of all physical, chemical, and biological processes that alter a sediment after its initial deposition and throughout its burial history, exclusive of weathering and metamorphism. In the lacustrine carbonates of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these processes are the primary control on reservoir quality, with burial-related dissolution by CO2-rich fluids being the dominant mechanism for generating the extensive secondary porosity that characterizes these prolific reservoirs."
erosion,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geological process' that removes and transports geological materials, which directly matches the category definition.","Erosion is a geological process that removes and transports geological materials, such as rock fragments and solutes, from a surface via agents like flowing water or wind. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, subaerial erosion during periods of relative sea-level fall is the primary mechanism for developing karst features and secondary porosity that create high-quality carbonate reservoirs. This process generates major unconformities that act as key surfaces within the petroleum system, influencing reservoir distribution and seal integrity."
lacustrine carbonate,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'non-marine carbonate rock', which is a rock constituted by a collection of sedimentary particles.","A lacustrine carbonate is a non-marine carbonate rock that, in the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, is precipitated chemically and biogenically in a saline-alkaline rift lake system. Its deposition is often microbially mediated, resulting in unique reservoir facies composed of spherulites, shrubs, and bivalve coquinas."
coquina,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines coquina as a 'bioclastic carbonate rock' composed of accumulated shells, which directly aligns with the definition of a rock constituted by sedimentary particles.","A coquina is a bioclastic carbonate rock that is composed predominantly of mechanically accumulated and fragmented shells of lacustrine bivalves and gastropods. It is characteristically deposited in high-energy shoreline and shoal environments within the Aptian sag-phase saline lacustrine systems. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these rocks constitute world-class petroleum reservoirs where primary interparticle porosity is significantly enhanced by the diagenetic dissolution of shells, creating extensive moldic porosity."
barremian,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geological age' and an 'epoch,' which is a specific interval of geological time during which depositional processes occurred.","The Barremian is a geological age of the Early Cretaceous epoch that, in the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, corresponds to the deposition of the main lacustrine source rocks of the supersequence rift. These organic-rich shales and coquinas were deposited in a restricted intracontinental rift setting prior to the main sag phase. They constitute the primary charging system for the overlying Aptian carbonate reservoirs."
facies,Sedimentary Facies,"The NLD defines a facies as a body of rock distinguished by a 'specific set of lithological, biological, and textural characteristics,' which directly corresponds to the definition of Sedimentary Facies as the sum of sedimentological characteristics.","A facies is a body of rock that is distinguished by a specific set of lithological, biological, and textural characteristics. These attributes are the product of a particular depositional environment within the Pre-Salt lacustrine carbonate system. The identification and mapping of facies are fundamental for predicting the distribution of reservoir quality."
carbonate reservoir,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as a 'subsurface rock body' composed of 'carbonate facies,' which is a geological object constituted by sedimentary rock.","A carbonate reservoir is a subsurface rock body that is composed predominantly of lacustrine carbonate facies, such as microbialites and spherulites, whose complex pore system, created by depositional and diagenetic processes, allows for the accumulation and production of hydrocarbons."
onlap,Geological Contact,"The NLD defines onlap as a 'stratigraphic relationship' where younger strata terminate against an older surface, which directly aligns with the definition of a Geological Contact as a relational quality between two adjacent geological objects.","Onlap is a base-discordant stratigraphic relationship that is characterized by the progressive updip termination of initially inclined younger strata against a more steeply dipping older surface. This relationship indicates a relative rise in base level, which in the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt is fundamental to mapping the expansion of lacustrine carbonate reservoirs over pre-existing topography. The resulting pinch-out geometries are a primary mechanism for creating stratigraphic traps within the microbialite and coquina facies."
rudstone,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines a rudstone as a 'grain-supported carbonate rock', which is a type of rock constituted by a collection of sedimentary grains.","A rudstone is a grain-supported carbonate rock that is texturally defined by having more than 10% of its grains larger than 2 mm, which in the Brazilian Pre-Salt are typically reworked microbialites or bioclasts from high-energy settings. This fabric commonly preserves significant primary interparticle porosity, making it a key reservoir facies."
ostracod,Geological Object,"The NLD describes an ostracod as a microfossil, which is a rigid entity with its own identity and unity criteria, generated by the geological process of fossilization.","An ostracod is a bivalved crustacean microfossil that is a primary rock-forming component within the lacustrine carbonate systems of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. The massive accumulation of its calcite carapaces forms coquinas, which are highly porous grainstones and packstones that constitute the most prolific petroleum reservoir facies. These deposits are characteristic of the Aptian sag section and are fundamental to understanding reservoir quality and distribution."
packstone,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines a packstone as a 'grain-supported carbonate rock', which is a rock constituted by a collection of sedimentary grains and particles.","A packstone is a grain-supported carbonate rock that is characterized by a fabric where constituent allochems are in contact and the interparticle volume is filled with carbonate mud. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these allochems are typically non-traditional grains like spherulites, peloids, and fragments of calcareous shrubs. The presence of this mud matrix significantly reduces primary reservoir quality compared to a grainstone, making its economic potential highly dependent on diagenetic enhancement."
shrub,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines a shrub as a 'microbial carbonate' and a 'fundamental building block' of reservoirs formed in a 'lacustrine setting,' which aligns with the definition of a depositional unit.","A shrub is a microbial carbonate that is characterized by a macroscopic, dendritic, branching fabric formed through organomineralization in a lacustrine setting. It is a fundamental building block of the highly productive Aptian-age reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. This structure is a primary control on the development of high-quality porosity and permeability."
silica,Earth Material,"The NLD defines silica as a silicon dioxide compound that acts as a pore-filling cement or replacement mineral, which aligns with the definition of a natural amount of matter generated by a geological process.","Silica is a silicon dioxide compound that acts as a significant diagenetic agent within Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonate successions. It commonly occurs as a replacement of host rock minerals or as a pore-filling cement, sourced primarily from hydrothermal fluids or the alteration of associated magmatic rocks. This silicification process typically results in the occlusion of porosity, representing a major control on reservoir quality degradation."
carbonate platform,Depositional Unit,"The NLD describes it as a 'large-scale sedimentary body' accumulated in a 'depositional environment', which fits the definition of a mappable Sedimentary Geological Object.","A carbonate platform is a large-scale sedimentary body that is composed predominantly of in situ microbial and abiotic carbonates accumulated in a shallow, restricted depositional environment. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these platforms developed within an extensive saline lacustrine system during the sag phase of continental rifting. Their complex internal facies architecture and significant diagenetic overprint are the primary controls on the distribution of world-class reservoir properties."
shale,Sedimentary Rock,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'fine-grained siliciclastic sedimentary rock'.,"A shale is a fine-grained siliciclastic sedimentary rock that is composed of clay- and silt-sized particles and exhibits fissility. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it represents the primary organic-rich lacustrine source rock responsible for generating the hydrocarbons accumulated in the overlying carbonate reservoirs."
volcanic,Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as 'an igneous rock', which is a solid consolidated Earth Material, directly fitting the GeoCore 'Rock' category.","A volcanic rock is an igneous rock that results from the extrusion and rapid cooling of magma at or near the Earth's surface. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these rocks are predominantly mafic lava flows and shallow intrusions that are interlayered with the syn-rift and sag-phase carbonate successions. Their presence critically impacts the petroleum system by forming seals, compartmentalizing reservoirs, and influencing the local thermal gradient."
anhydrite,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD describes anhydrite as an evaporite mineral that constitutes extensive layers and acts as a regional seal, which are characteristics of a consolidated sedimentary rock body.","Anhydrite is an evaporite mineral composed of anhydrous calcium sulfate (CaSO₄) that constitutes extensive layers within the Aptian sag section of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. In this setting, it acts as a primary component of the regional seal, effectively trapping hydrocarbons within the underlying microbial carbonate reservoirs. It also occurs as a diagenetic phase within the reservoir facies, where its precipitation or subsequent dissolution significantly impacts porosity and permeability."
stevensite,Earth Material,"The NLD defines stevensite as a clay mineral, which is a naturally occurring solid amount of matter generated by a geological process (precipitation), fitting the definition of Earth Material.","Stevensite is an authigenic, magnesium-rich smectite-group clay mineral that precipitates from the hypersaline, alkaline lacustrine brines of the Brazilian Pre-Salt sag phase. It is intimately associated with microbial carbonate reservoir facies, where it forms grain coatings and pore-filling cements. Its presence significantly controls petrophysical properties by creating extensive microporosity, which reduces effective permeability and complicates formation evaluation."
tectonic,quality,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'property of a geological process or feature,' which directly aligns with the BFO definition of a quality.","Tectonic is a property of a geological process or feature that results from the large-scale deformation of the Earth's lithosphere. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this property is primarily associated with the continental rifting and extensional faulting that formed the Santos and Campos basins during the opening of the South Atlantic. These processes created the horst and graben structures which constitute the fundamental structural traps for the vast microbial carbonate reservoirs."
stromatolite,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as an 'organosedimentary structure' formed by mineral precipitation, which is a type of geological object constituted by sedimentary rock.","A stromatolite is a laminated microbialite that is formed by the trapping, binding, and/or microbially-induced precipitation of carbonate minerals by microbial mats. These organosedimentary structures constitute a primary reservoir facies within the lacustrine carbonate successions of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Their framework and subsequent diagenesis can generate exceptional porosity and permeability."
carbonate rock,Sedimentary Rock,The NLD explicitly defines the term as 'a sedimentary rock that is composed predominantly of carbonate minerals'.,"A carbonate rock is a sedimentary rock that is composed predominantly of carbonate minerals, such as calcite and dolomite. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, these rocks are characteristically formed by microbial and/or physicochemical precipitation in sag-phase lacustrine environments. Subsequent diagenetic alteration creates the complex and heterogeneous pore networks that constitute the main hydrocarbon reservoirs."
cement,Earth Material,"The NLD defines cement as an authigenic mineral that precipitates from fluids to fill pores, which fits the definition of Earth Material as a natural amount of solid matter generated by a geological process.","Cement is an authigenic mineral that precipitates from formation fluids within the pore system of a rock, binding sedimentary particles together and reducing porosity. In the lacustrine carbonates of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, early fibrous and late blocky calcite cements are primary controls on reservoir quality evolution. These cements occlude the primary porosity between particles such as spherulites and bioclasts, significantly impacting reservoir performance."
intraclast,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines an intraclast as a 'carbonate clast' derived from the erosion of 'semi-consolidated sediment,' which fits the definition of a Geological Object constituted by sedimentary material.","An intraclast is a carbonate clast that is derived from the penecontemporaneous erosion of semi-consolidated sediment within the same depositional basin. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine system, these clasts are typically composed of fragments of microbialite crusts or carbonate mudstone that have been reworked by high-energy events. Their accumulation can form grain-supported textures, such as rudstones, which may constitute significant reservoir facies."
microbialite,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as an 'organosedimentary carbonate rock,' which directly aligns with the definition of a rock constituted by sedimentary particles or processes.","A microbialite is an organosedimentary carbonate rock that results from the in-situ precipitation of minerals directly induced or influenced by the metabolic activity of microorganisms. These deposits form the primary reservoir facies within the lacustrine sag section of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. They are characterized by distinctive internal fabrics, such as shrubs and spherulites, which create a complex and heterogeneous pore system."
subsidence,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geodynamic process' involving the downward movement of the Earth's crust, which modifies geological objects.","Subsidence is a geodynamic process of gradual downward movement of the Earth's crust that is driven by tectonic extension, thermal contraction, and sediment loading. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is fundamental for creating the accommodation space required for the deposition of the entire petroleum system, from the syn-rift lacustrine source rocks to the sag-phase microbial carbonate reservoirs. Continued subsidence ensures the progressive burial and thermal maturation of source rocks, which is essential for hydrocarbon generation and accumulation."
basalt,Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'mafic volcanic rock,' which directly aligns with the GeoCore definition of Rock as a solid consolidated Earth Material.","Basalt is a mafic volcanic rock that typically constitutes the economic basement to the Pre-Salt petroleum systems. Associated with the Early Cretaceous South Atlantic rifting, it forms a high-impedance acoustic basement beneath the sag-phase lacustrine deposits. Its presence and thickness are critical controls on the regional geothermal gradient, directly impacting the maturation of the Pre-Salt source rocks."
sag phase,Geological Process,"The NLD defines a 'sag phase' as a stage of basin evolution driven by a series of physical processes, such as thermal subsidence and deposition, that modify geological objects.","A sag phase is a stage of post-rift basin evolution that is driven by broad, regional thermal subsidence following the cessation of active crustal extension. This phase creates the critical accommodation space for the deposition of the lacustrine source rocks and microbial carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. The culmination of the sag phase is marked by the deposition of the Aptian evaporites, which form the regional seal for this prolific petroleum system."
compaction,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines compaction as a 'diagenetic process' that modifies the volume and porosity of sediments, which is a direct match to this category's definition.","Compaction is a diagenetic process that reduces the bulk volume and porosity of sediments under the progressive increase of effective stress. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, this process encompasses both mechanical adjustments, like grain crushing and repacking, and chemical dissolution at grain contacts, leading to stylolitization. It is a primary mechanism of reservoir quality degradation that governs the evolution of pore systems and fluid expulsion during burial."
mound,Mound Unit,"The NLD describes a carbonate buildup forming a positive topographic feature, which is consistent with the definition of a Mound Unit as a Depositional Unit with mound geometry.","A mound is a carbonate buildup that forms a positive topographic feature on the lake floor, is composed primarily of in situ precipitated non-skeletal carbonates, and lacks a rigid organic framework. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these buildups are typically formed by microbialites and fascicular calcite crusts in a saline, alkaline lacustrine system. They constitute a primary reservoir facies due to their high depositional porosity and permeability."
silicification,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'diagenetic process' that modifies the composition of rock by replacing minerals, which directly fits the definition of a Geological Process.","Silicification is a diagenetic process that involves the replacement of carbonate minerals by authigenic silica, typically as microcrystalline quartz or chert. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process commonly affects lacustrine microbialite and coquina facies, creating low-permeability zones that can act as baffles or seals. This alteration significantly impacts reservoir heterogeneity by occluding primary porosity and modifying fluid flow pathways."
accommodation space,site,"The NLD defines it as a 'potential depositional volume' whose boundaries are determined by material entities (lake surface, sediment-water interface), which matches the BFO definition of a three-dimensional immaterial entity.","Accommodation space is the potential depositional volume that exists between the lake surface and the sediment-water interface. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt's lacustrine rift basins, this volume is primarily generated by the interplay between tectonic subsidence and climate-driven lake-level fluctuations. The rate of its creation relative to the carbonate sediment supply rate governs the resulting stratigraphic architecture and reservoir facies distribution."
halite,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD defines halite as an evaporite mineral that constitutes a massive salt succession, which is a type of chemical sedimentary rock.",Halite is an evaporite mineral composed of sodium chloride that constitutes the massive and ductile Aptian salt succession. This succession functions as the principal regional seal for the underlying carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system due to its extremely low permeability. Its ductile flow is also a primary control on the formation of structural traps and the focusing of heat flow into the subsalt section.
cretaceous,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geologic period,' which is a temporal region during which geological processes like deposition and rifting occurred.","Cretaceous is a geologic period of the Mesozoic Era that encompasses the Early Cretaceous rifting of the South Atlantic and the subsequent deposition of the Brazilian Pre-Salt sag-phase successions. This period is fundamentally important as it includes the formation of the Aptian lacustrine source rocks, microbial carbonate reservoirs, and the overlying regional evaporitic seal. The Late Cretaceous marks the deposition of the initial post-salt marine carbonate section which provides the overburden for hydrocarbon maturation."
evaporation,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines evaporation as a 'physicochemical process' that transforms matter and triggers the precipitation of halite, which aligns with the definition of a Geological Process.","Evaporation is a physicochemical process that transforms liquid water into vapor, which in the restricted Aptian sag basin led to the progressive concentration of dissolved salts. This process increased brine salinity to the point of supersaturation. Consequently, it triggered the massive precipitation of halite that constitutes the primary regional seal of the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system."
hauterivian,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD defines the term as a 'chronostratigraphic stage' and a 'syn-rift interval,' which is a temporal region during which geological processes occur.","The Hauterivian is a chronostratigraphic stage of the Lower Cretaceous series that, within the Brazilian Pre-Salt succession, represents the main syn-rift interval for the deposition of the primary lacustrine source rocks. This stage is characterized by the organic-rich shales and coquinas of the Lagoa Feia Group and equivalent formations. These rocks are responsible for charging the super-giant carbonate reservoirs of the petroleum system."
laminate,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines a laminate as a 'depositional layer', which is a type of geological object constituted by sedimentary material.","A laminate is a millimeter-scale depositional layer that is visually distinct from adjacent layers due to variations in composition, texture, or organic matter content. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these layers are characteristically of microbial origin, forming rhythmic successions of carbonate and organic-rich material within lacustrine depositional systems. The nature and arrangement of these laminates fundamentally control the heterogeneity and quality of microbialite reservoirs."
recrystallized,Geological Process,"The NLD describes recrystallization as a 'neomorphic process' and an 'alteration' that modifies a rock's fabric, which aligns with the definition of a geological process that modifies a Geological Object.","A recrystallized carbonate is a reservoir rock that exhibits a diagenetic fabric resulting from the in-situ transformation of its primary crystals into a new, typically coarser, crystal mosaic. This neomorphic process fundamentally alters the original depositional texture, such as that of microbialites or spherulites, thereby modifying the rock's porosity and permeability system. The alteration occurs in the solid state without changing the essential mineralogy, driven by changes in pore fluid chemistry and temperature during burial."
salt,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines salt as an 'evaporite rock' that forms a large-scale, functional body ('regional seal'), which is a geological object constituted by sedimentary rock.",Salt is an evaporite rock that is predominantly composed of halite and functions as the primary regional seal in the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system. Its characteristic low permeability and ductile rheology prevent the vertical migration of hydrocarbons and drive halokinesis. This process creates complex structural traps and controls the depositional architecture of both the pre-salt reservoirs and post-salt sequences.
travertine,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'variety of lacustrine carbonate rock' formed by the precipitation of calcite, which fits the definition of a rock constituted by sedimentary particles.","Travertine is a variety of lacustrine carbonate rock that is formed by the predominantly abiogenic precipitation of calcite from CO₂-rich hydrothermal fluids or groundwaters discharging into an alkaline lake system. It typically exhibits crystalline crusts and distinctive dendritic, shrub-like fabrics indicative of rapid, fluid-expulsion-related deposition. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these deposits constitute an important reservoir facies, often associated with fault systems that served as fluid conduits."
seismic data,generically dependent continuant,"The NLD defines this as a 'geophysical dataset that digitally represents' the subsurface, which fits the concept of an informational pattern or content that can be copied.","Seismic data is a geophysical dataset that digitally represents the subsurface acoustic response to a controlled energy source, processed to image geological structures and stratigraphic variations. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is the fundamental tool used to delineate the complex structural-stratigraphic architecture of carbonate reservoirs situated beneath the thick Aptian evaporitic sequence. This dataset enables the characterization of reservoir geometry, internal facies distribution, and the identification of hydrocarbon accumulations."
deposit,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines the term as a 'geological body that is formed by the accumulation of... sediments,' which directly matches the definition of a Sedimentary Geological Object.","A deposit is a geological body that is formed by the accumulation of primarily lacustrine carbonate sediments and is distinguished by its characteristic facies, geometry, and petrophysical properties. This body constitutes a potential reservoir interval within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system."
salt deposit,Sedimentary Geological Object,The NLD defines it as a geological body ('thick... succession') constituted by sedimentary rock ('evaporite succession... predominantly composed of halite').,"A salt deposit is a thick, mobile evaporite succession of Aptian age that forms the regional seal for the underlying lacustrine carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. It is predominantly composed of halite but characteristically includes significant layers of anhydrite, carnallite, and tachyhydrite. This succession's low density and viscosity drive complex halokinetic deformation, which creates structural traps and influences the regional thermal regime."
wackestone,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines wackestone as a 'carbonate rock' composed of grains and a mud matrix, which fits the definition of a rock constituted by a collection of sedimentary particles.","A wackestone is a matrix-supported carbonate rock that is composed of more than 10% grains suspended within a dominant carbonate mud matrix. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine successions, these grains often consist of microbial fragments, spherulites, and peloids, set in a matrix of precipitated or microbially-mediated calcite mud. Its primary fabric typically has low permeability, but it can form effective reservoirs where diagenetic dissolution has created significant secondary porosity."
peloid,Geological Object,"The NLD describes a peloid as a distinct carbonate grain or allochem, which is a rigid entity with its own identity and unity, fitting the definition of a Geological Object.","A peloid is a carbonate allochem that is composed of cryptocrystalline carbonate and lacks a discernible internal nucleus or structure. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these grains are frequently interpreted as being of microbial origin, forming the primary framework of high-energy, lacustrine grainstone facies. Their accumulation is fundamental to the development of extensive reservoir intervals with high interparticle porosity."
secondary porosity,site,"The NLD defines the term as a 'pore system' of 'vuggy, moldic, and cavernous pores', which are holes or voids within a rock, fitting the BFO definition of a site.","Secondary porosity is a pore system that develops within a rock subsequent to its deposition, typically resulting from diagenetic processes such as the dissolution of grains and cements by meteoric fluids during subaerial exposure. This process creates interconnected vuggy, moldic, and cavernous pores that significantly enhance the reservoir quality of Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates. It is distinct from primary porosity, which is inherent to the rock at the time of deposition."

In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these faults are the primary structural elements formed during the Aptian rifting of the South Atlantic, creating the horst and graben topography that controlled the deposition of microbial carbonate and coquina reservoirs. They are critical components of the petroleum system, forming structural traps and acting as conduits for hydrocarbon migration from lacustrine source rocks in the grabens to reservoirs on the structural highs."

This stage is characterized by the deposition of the first widespread marine sediments, such as the Macaé and Guaratiba groups, directly overlying the Aptian evaporite sequence. These deposits constitute the base of the post-salt succession and are a critical component of the overburden for the Pre-Salt petroleum system."
depositional model,generically dependent continuant,"The NLD describes a depositional model as a 'synthesis' and 'framework,' which is an informational pattern or content, not a physical object, fitting the definition of a generically dependent continuant.","A depositional model is a geological synthesis that integrates seismic, well log, and core data to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental processes and resulting facies architecture of a sedimentary system. It provides a predictive framework for the three-dimensional distribution and reservoir quality of sedimentary bodies, such as the lacustrine microbial carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. This model is fundamental for de-risking exploration prospects and optimizing reservoir development strategies."

It represents a fundamental depositional increment, such as a single growth phase of microbialites or a coquina storm deposit. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it constitutes the elementary building block for the characterization of reservoir flow units."
graben,Geological Object,"The NLD defines a graben as a 'structural block of crust,' which fits the definition of a Geological Object as a rigid entity with its own identity, generated by a geological process (rifting).","A graben is an elongated, down-dropped structural block of crust that is bounded by high-angle normal faults formed during continental rifting. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum systems, these rift-phase depressions acted as the principal depocenters for the accumulation and preservation of rich lacustrine source rocks. The resulting horst-and-graben paleotopography subsequently controlled the deposition of the overlying sag-phase carbonate reservoirs."
horst,Geological Structure,"The NLD defines a horst as an 'uplifted fault block' and a 'structural high' resulting from faulting, which fits the definition of a configuration and arrangement of a Geological Object's parts.",A horst is an uplifted fault block that is bounded by conjugate normal faults formed during the syn-rift phase of the South Atlantic opening.

In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these attributes differentiate key carbonate reservoir types, such as microbialites and coquinas, based on their unique fabric and composition. This classification serves as the fundamental unit for geological modeling and predicting reservoir quality distribution."
seal,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines a seal as a 'lithostratigraphic unit' which is a mappable body of deposited rock, aligning with the definition of a Depositional Unit.","A seal is a lithostratigraphic unit that possesses high capillary entry pressure and extremely low permeability, effectively preventing the vertical or lateral migration of hydrocarbons out of a reservoir. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this function is primarily performed by the thick Aptian evaporite sequence, which forms the regional top seal for the underlying carbonate reservoirs. Intra-formational seals, such as dense carbonate mudstones or tightly cemented coquinas, may also create localized hydrocarbon accumulations within the main reservoir section."

The distinct lithofacies are controlled by the lake's unique, often saline to hypersaline, water chemistry."
petroleum system,Depositional System,"The NLD describes a system as an aggregate of linked geological elements (source rock, reservoir, seal), which are typically depositional units, matching the definition of a Depositional System.","A petroleum system is a dynamic geological system that encompasses the essential elements and processes required for the generation, migration, and accumulation of hydrocarbons. This framework genetically links a pod of active source rock, such as the lacustrine coquinas of the Sag phase, to the resulting accumulations in reservoirs like the Pre-Salt microbialites. The system's viability is critically dependent on the correct temporal relationship between trap formation and hydrocarbon charge, all preserved beneath a regional seal like the extensive Aptian salt layer."
post-rift,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD defines the term as a 'tectono-stratigraphic stage' that follows the cessation of a specific geological process, which directly corresponds to an interval of geological time.","Post-rift is a tectono-stratigraphic stage that follows the cessation of active crustal extension and is primarily controlled by regional thermal subsidence.

In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is fundamental to the formation of both the carbonate reservoir facies, such as spherulitic microbialites, and the overlying evaporitic seal. Subsequent diagenetic precipitates, including calcite and dolomite cements, critically control the final porosity and permeability of the reservoir."
alkaline lake,Depositional System,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'continental lacustrine depositional system' where processes generate facies and rocks that constitute source and reservoir units.,"An alkaline lake is a continental lacustrine depositional system that is characterized by water with a pH typically above 9 due to high concentrations of dissolved carbonate and bicarbonate ions. This specific geochemical condition is a key element of the Brazilian Pre-Salt sag phase, controlling the prolific development of microbial communities and the inorganic precipitation of carbonates. These processes are responsible for generating the unique and extensive microbialite and coquina facies that constitute the main source and reservoir rocks in basins like Santos and Campos."
limestone,Sedimentary Rock,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'carbonate sedimentary rock'.,"A limestone is a carbonate sedimentary rock that is composed predominantly of calcium carbonate. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these rocks are primarily of lacustrine origin, formed through microbial mediation, abiotic precipitation of spherulites, and the accumulation of mollusk bioclasts in saline, alkaline lakes. These limestones constitute prolific petroleum reservoirs, where primary porosity is often significantly enhanced by diagenetic dissolution."
acoustic impedance,quality,"The NLD defines it as an 'intrinsic physical rock property' that inheres in a geological medium, which aligns with the BFO definition of a quality.","Acoustic impedance is an intrinsic physical rock property that is the product of a material's bulk density and seismic P-wave velocity. It quantifies the resistance of a geological medium to the propagation of a seismic wave, where its contrast between adjacent layers is the fundamental control on the generation of seismic reflections. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is the primary property derived from seismic inversion to discriminate between salt, reservoir carbonates, and non-reservoir facies, as well as to infer porosity and fluid content."

These structures represent the fundamental depocenters of the South Atlantic syn-rift phase, controlling the creation of accommodation space. This accommodation was essential for the development of the deep lacustrine environments where the Pre-Salt's prolific source rocks and unique microbial carbonate reservoirs were deposited."
petrophysical property,quality,"The NLD defines the term as a 'quantifiable attribute of a rock formation,' which aligns with the BFO definition of a quality that inheres in a bearer.","A petrophysical property is a quantifiable attribute of a rock formation that describes its capacity to store and transmit fluids and its response to physical measurements. Key properties such as porosity, permeability, and water saturation are fundamental for characterizing the storage capacity and producibility of a reservoir. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, these properties are highly heterogeneous due to complex depositional fabrics and diagenetic overprints, directly controlling hydrocarbon accumulation and reservoir performance."
salt layer,Depositional Unit,"The NLD describes it as a 'thick and extensive stratigraphic unit' composed of sedimentary rock (evaporites), which fits the definition of a Sedimentary Geological Object recognizable at a mapping scale.","A salt layer is a thick and extensive stratigraphic unit of Aptian age that is composed primarily of evaporite minerals, including halite, anhydrite, and tachyhydrite. Characterized by its ductile rheology, this unit was deposited in a restricted marine sag basin during the final rifting stage of the South Atlantic Ocean, leading to the formation of complex halokinetic structures. It constitutes the primary regional seal of the Pre-Salt petroleum system, trapping vast hydrocarbon accumulations in the underlying lacustrine carbonate reservoirs."
aragonite,Earth Material,"The NLD defines aragonite as a carbonate mineral, which is a natural amount of solid matter generated by a geological process, fitting the definition of Earth Material.","Aragonite is a carbonate mineral that is the metastable, orthorhombic polymorph of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃). It is the inferred primary precipitate for the microbialite reservoir facies of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, having formed in the high-alkalinity lacustrine depositional system. The subsequent diagenetic transformation of aragonite to calcite is a principal control on the creation and evolution of the reservoir pore system."
deep water,site,"The NLD describes a 'depositional environment,' which is a three-dimensional immaterial location defined by its relation to other geological features, fitting the definition of a site.","Deep water is a lacustrine depositional environment that is situated below the effective wave base and basinward of the carbonate platform margin in a rift setting.

This tectonic framework created the accommodation space and thermal regime for the pre-salt petroleum system. It governs the deposition and distribution of the lacustrine source rocks, microbial carbonate reservoirs, and the regional Aptian salt seal."
sequence,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines a sequence as a 'fundamental stratigraphic unit' and a 'package of strata,' which aligns with the definition of a recognizable, mappable Sedimentary Geological Object.","A sequence is a fundamental stratigraphic unit of the Pre-Salt succession that comprises a genetically related package of strata deposited during a single cycle of base-level change. It is bounded by regionally significant surfaces, such as subaerial unconformities or major lacustrine flooding surfaces, which separate distinct depositional systems. The characterization of these sequences is critical for predicting the distribution and quality of microbialite and coquina reservoirs and their associated evaporitic seals."

alkaline lacustrine environment,Depositional System,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'continental depositional system' where various geological materials are formed and preserved.,"An alkaline lacustrine environment is a continental depositional system that is characterized by a large, restricted, and chemically stratified lake with elevated pH and alkalinity. This specific geochemistry, prevalent during the Brazilian Pre-Salt sag phase, promoted the widespread precipitation of unique microbial and spherulitic carbonates that constitute the primary reservoirs. The anoxic bottom waters within this system also favored the preservation of organic matter, generating the prolific source rocks of the petroleum system."
formation,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines a formation as a fundamental, mappable lithostratigraphic unit representing a major depositional sequence, which is consistent with the definition of a Depositional Unit.","A formation is the fundamental lithostratigraphic unit that is defined by a distinct and genetically related assemblage of rock facies, making it identifiable and mappable in the subsurface via seismic and well data. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, a formation represents a major depositional sequence, such as the Aptian lacustrine carbonates of the Barra Velha Formation. It typically constitutes a primary element of the petroleum system, most notably as the main reservoir interval."
uplift,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines uplift as a 'tectonic process' that causes the vertical elevation of a crustal block, which modifies the shape and arrangement of geological objects.","Uplift is a tectonic process that causes the vertical elevation of a crustal block relative to a reference datum, such as sea level. This mechanism is a primary control on the structural configuration of the Pre-Salt rift section, defining the geometry of horsts and grabens that form structural traps. Consequently, episodes of uplift and subsequent erosion critically impact the petroleum system by altering the burial history, thermal maturation of source rocks, and the integrity of reservoir seals."
carbonate deposit,Depositional Unit,"The NLD describes this as a 'sedimentary body' that developed in 'extensive' environments, which aligns with the definition of a large-scale, mappable Sedimentary Geological Object.","A carbonate deposit is a sedimentary body that is predominantly composed of carbonate minerals formed through microbial and/or physicochemical precipitation from an aqueous solution. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, these deposits typically developed in extensive, alkaline lacustrine environments during the sag phase of rift basin evolution. They constitute the primary reservoir facies, characterized by complex diagenetic overprints that control their highly variable porosity and permeability."
chalcedony,Earth Material,"The NLD defines chalcedony as a 'cryptocrystalline silica mineral', which is a natural, solid amount of matter generated by a geological process, fitting the definition of an Earth Material.","Chalcedony is a cryptocrystalline silica mineral that functions as a diagenetic product in the lacustrine carbonate successions of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. It most commonly occurs as a pore-occluding cement or as a replacement of precursor carbonate minerals, thereby controlling reservoir quality. The precipitation is driven by silica-rich fluids derived from volcanic or hydrothermal sources within the rift basin."

This layer, composed primarily of extended and thinned continental rock, underlies the entire sedimentary succession, including the Pre-Salt section. Its thermo-tectonic evolution during the South Atlantic rifting directly controlled the heat flow and structural framework essential for the formation of the Pre-Salt petroleum systems."
cyclothem,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines a cyclothem as a 'fundamental...succession of genetically related...strata' that constitutes a 'primary building block' of reservoirs, which aligns with the definition of a recognizable sedimentary geological object.","A cyclothem is a fundamental shallowing-upward succession of genetically related carbonate strata that records a single, high-frequency lake-level fluctuation within the Aptian lacustrine sag basin. These successions constitute the primary building blocks of the Pre-Salt reservoirs, where the granular facies at the top of the cycle, such as coquinas and spherulites, form the most productive intervals. The stacking patterns of these cyclothems, driven by climatic and tectonic forcing, govern the overall reservoir architecture and heterogeneity."
depositional setting,Depositional System,"The NLD defines the term as a geological system governing the genesis and distribution of sedimentary bodies, which aligns with a Depositional System being an aggregate of linked Depositional Units.","A depositional setting is a geological system that is defined by the specific interplay of physical, chemical, and biological processes which govern the genesis, geometry, and facies distribution of sedimentary bodies. In the lacustrine carbonate systems of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this setting directly controls the primary architecture and quality of microbialite and coquina reservoirs. Its interpretation is therefore fundamental to predicting hydrocarbon accumulation and reservoir performance."
dolomite cement,Earth Material,"The NLD describes it as a natural amount of solid matter (a cement composed of the mineral dolomite) generated by a geological process (diagenesis), which fits the definition of Earth Material.","Dolomite cement is an authigenic carbonate cement that is composed of the mineral dolomite (CaMg(CO₃)₂) and precipitates within the pore network of a host rock during diagenesis. It is a critical control on reservoir quality in the Brazilian Pre-Salt, where its precipitation during burial significantly reduces or destroys the primary porosity of microbialite and coquina facies. This process is often driven by the migration of magnesium-rich fluids derived from underlying sag-phase lacustrine shales or the alteration of associated mafic rocks."

Commonly interpreted as a microbial or chemical precipitate from alkaline lacustrine waters, it constitutes the matrix for spherulitic and shrub-like fabrics as well as laminated microbialites. Its texture and subsequent diagenetic alteration are a primary control on the porosity and permeability of the reservoir system."
organic-rich shale,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'fine-grained petroleum source rock', which is a rock constituted by a collection of sedimentary particles.","An organic-rich shale is a fine-grained petroleum source rock that is characterized by a high concentration of preserved organic matter deposited within an anoxic, typically lacustrine, environment. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, these shales constitute the primary source for the hydrocarbons accumulated in the overlying carbonate reservoirs. Upon reaching thermal maturity, the kerogen within the shale is converted into oil and gas."
regional seal,Depositional Unit,"The NLD describes a regional seal as a 'thick and laterally extensive stratigraphic unit', which fits the definition of a Depositional Unit as a large, mappable sedimentary body.","A regional seal is a thick and laterally extensive stratigraphic unit that is characterized by extremely low permeability, providing the ultimate top seal for a petroleum system across a basin or sub-basin. In the Brazilian Santos and Campos basins, the Aptian salt layer functions as the quintessential regional seal, trapping vast hydrocarbon accumulations within the underlying pre-salt carbonate reservoirs. Its ductile nature allows it to maintain sealing integrity despite subsequent tectonic deformation."
reservoir heterogeneity,Geological Structure,"The NLD describes a 'spatial variation' and 'complex architecture' of properties within a rock body, which fits the definition of a Geological Structure as the internal arrangement and configuration of a Geological Object.","Reservoir heterogeneity is the spatial variation of geological and petrophysical properties within a rock body that governs the storage and flow of hydrocarbons. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, this condition is primarily controlled by the complex interplay between original depositional facies, such as microbialites and coquinas, and subsequent multi-stage diagenetic overprints including dissolution and cementation. This variation creates a complex architecture of flow units, baffles, and barriers that directly impacts reservoir performance and production strategy."
reservoir interval,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines the term as a 'subsurface stratigraphic unit' composed of rocks, which aligns with the definition of a Depositional Unit as a recognizable Sedimentary Geological Object.","A reservoir interval is a subsurface stratigraphic unit that is defined by specific top and base boundaries and contains rocks with effective porosity and permeability capable of storing and transmitting hydrocarbons. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these intervals are predominantly composed of lacustrine carbonates, such as microbialites and coquinas, where porosity is significantly enhanced by diagenetic dissolution. Its boundaries are typically determined through the integrated analysis of well logs, core data, and seismic attributes, using petrophysical cutoffs."
reworked,Geological Age,"The NLD defines 'reworked' as a property of a geological object resulting from a specific geological process (transport and redeposition), which aligns with the definition of Geological Age as a quality related to a geological process.","Reworked is a property of a sedimentary particle or deposit that has been dislodged from its original depositional site, transported, and redeposited by physical agents such as waves, currents, or gravity flows. This process is critical in the Brazilian Pre-Salt for concentrating porous carbonate grains, such as spherulites and bioclasts, into well-sorted, grain-supported facies. These reworked deposits often form the highest quality and most productive reservoir intervals within the lacustrine carbonate system."
sediment-water interface,Geological Boundary,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'physical and biogeochemical boundary that separates' the water column from the sediment, which is the core concept of a Geological Boundary.","A sediment-water interface is a physical and biogeochemical boundary that separates the water column of a depositional environment from the underlying unconsolidated sediment. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine systems, this surface is the critical site for the accumulation of carbonate grains and organic matter, often under anoxic conditions. It also controls the initial stages of diagenesis and the development of microbial mats, which are fundamental to the formation of reservoir facies."

This rock type constitutes a principal reservoir facies in the Brazilian Pre-Salt due to its typically high and well-connected primary inter-shrub porosity."
silica nodule,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD describes it as a discrete mass ('nodule') composed of chert, a sedimentary rock, which forms within a larger sedimentary body (carbonates).",A silica nodule is a diagenetic feature that is composed predominantly of chert and forms as an irregularly shaped mass within Pre-Salt lacustrine carbonates. It originates from the localized replacement of the primary carbonate fabric by silica-rich fluids during burial. These nodules represent significant non-porous heterogeneities that reduce reservoir storage and baffle fluid flow.
structure,Geological Object,"The NLD describes the structure as a 'subsurface geological feature' and a 'horst block,' which is a rigid entity with its own identity criteria, consistent with the definition of a Geological Object.","A structure is a subsurface geological feature that results from tectonic deformation, creating a geometric closure capable of trapping hydrocarbons. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this feature is typically a large, basement-involved horst block formed during the South Atlantic rifting. The closure contains the carbonate reservoir and is vertically sealed by the thick Aptian evaporite sequence."
truncation,Geological Contact,"The NLD defines truncation as a geometric relationship describing the termination of strata against a surface, which fits the definition of a relational quality between two adjacent geological objects.","Truncation is a geometric relationship that describes the termination of older strata or seismic reflectors by a younger erosional surface or fault. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this feature is a critical element of stratigraphic and combination traps where carbonate reservoir facies are terminated updip against the Base Salt Unconformity. This relationship is fundamental for defining the lateral extent of reservoirs and calculating hydrocarbon volumes."
bathymetry,Geometry,"The NLD defines bathymetry as 'submarine topography' and 'configuration,' which is a quality describing the external three-dimensional shape of the basin floor.","Bathymetry is the submarine topography that describes the depth of a basin floor relative to the water level. The resulting paleo-bathymetric configuration is a primary control on the depositional architecture of a petroleum system. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it governs the distribution of both the microbial carbonate reservoirs on paleo-highs and the anoxic source rocks in basinal lows."
diagenetic process,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines this as a physical, chemical, or biological process that modifies sediments and sedimentary rocks, which directly matches the definition of a Geological Process.","A diagenetic process is any physical, chemical, or biological process that modifies sediments and sedimentary rocks after deposition and before the onset of metamorphism. These processes, including dissolution, cementation, and recrystallization, are the primary controls on the creation and destruction of porosity and permeability. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, the complex history of these processes under deep burial conditions dictates the ultimate reservoir quality of the microbialite and coquina facies."
dip,quality,"The NLD defines dip as an 'angular measurement' and a 'quantity' that describes the inclination of a geological surface, which aligns with the BFO definition of a quality as a dependent characteristic that inheres in an entity.","Dip is an angular measurement that quantifies the maximum inclination of a geological surface, such as a seismic reflector or fault plane, relative to the horizontal. This measurement is fundamental for defining the structural closures that form hydrocarbon traps within the Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs. It is a vector quantity fully described by its magnitude, the dip angle, and its direction, the dip azimuth."
oceanic crust,Geological Object,"The NLD describes it as a 'crustal domain' generated by a geological process (seafloor spreading), fitting the definition of a rigid entity with its own identity.","Oceanic crust is a high-density, mafic crustal domain that is generated at a seafloor spreading center following the complete rupture of continental lithosphere. In the context of the Brazilian margin, its formation marks the transition from the late syn-rift sag phase, characterized by the deposition of Pre-Salt source rocks and reservoirs, to the post-rift drift phase. This crust forms the deepwater basement upon which the thick post-salt marine sedimentary succession was deposited."
oil,Earth Fluid,"The NLD describes oil as a 'naturally occurring liquid hydrocarbon mixture' and a 'fluid', which directly corresponds to the Earth Fluid category, defined as an Earth Material representing a volume of fluid such as oil.","Oil is a naturally occurring liquid hydrocarbon mixture that is generated from the thermal maturation of organic matter within a source rock and subsequently accumulates in a subsurface reservoir. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this fluid is predominantly derived from lacustrine source rocks of the sag section. It is found primarily within Aptian microbial and coquina carbonate reservoirs, trapped beneath the regional salt layer."
passive margin,Depositional System,"The NLD describes a passive margin as a large-scale setting that controls the accumulation of thick, linked sedimentary successions (source rocks, reservoirs, seals), which corresponds to an aggregate of depositional units.","A passive margin is a continental margin that results from the cessation of continental rifting and the onset of seafloor spreading, transitioning from a tectonically active to an inactive state. This evolution is characterized by a long period of thermal subsidence that creates the accommodation space for thick sedimentary successions. In the South Atlantic, this setting governed the development of the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, controlling the deposition of syn-rift source rocks, sag-phase carbonate reservoirs, and the overlying regional salt seal."
post-rift phase,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD defines the term as a 'stage of basin evolution' that follows another, which corresponds to a temporal region occupied by specific geological processes like thermal subsidence and deposition.","A post-rift phase is a stage of basin evolution that follows the cessation of active crustal extension and is dominated by long-wavelength thermal subsidence. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt basins, this phase encompasses the deposition of the Aptian evaporites and the overlying thick marine carbonate and siliciclastic successions. The resulting sedimentary load provides the necessary overburden to mature the syn-rift source rocks, while the salt layer forms the regional seal for the pre-salt petroleum system."
prograde,Sedimentary Structure,"The NLD defines prograde as a 'stratigraphic stacking pattern' that controls architecture, which aligns with the definition of a Sedimentary Structure as a 'pattern of the internal arrangement of Depositional Units'.","Prograde is a stratigraphic stacking pattern that results from a carbonate production rate exceeding the rate of accommodation creation at a depositional margin. This pattern is characterized by the basinward or lakeward advance of facies, where successively younger strata are deposited further out from the margin in progressively shallower water depths. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is a primary control on the architecture and lateral extent of lacustrine carbonate reservoirs, such as microbialite and coquina buildups."
regional unconformity,Geological Boundary,"The NLD defines the term as a 'stratigraphic surface' that separates distinct geological successions, which aligns with the definition of a Geological Boundary as a physical discontinuity on the surface of a Geological Object.","A regional unconformity is a stratigraphic surface of basin-wide extent that represents a major hiatus due to erosion or non-deposition, separating distinct tectono-stratigraphic successions such as the Brazilian Pre-Salt rift sequence from the overlying Aptian salt. This surface acts as a primary seismic marker and frequently forms a critical component of the petroleum system by defining the top of the main reservoir interval and creating truncation traps."

In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these faults define the fundamental architecture of half-grabens, creating the accommodation space for the deposition of lacustrine source rocks and the overlying microbial carbonate reservoirs. Subsequently, these structures can act as critical pathways for hydrocarbon migration or form sealing boundaries that compartmentalize reservoirs."

Within the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these lows often represent the main hydrocarbon kitchens and are typically unfavorable for accumulation due to the updip migration of petroleum towards structural highs."
transfer zone,Geological Structure,"The NLD defines it as a 'zone of complex deformation' involving faults, which fits the definition of a Geological Structure as the configuration and mutual relationships of the parts of a Geological Object.","A transfer zone is a zone of complex deformation that accommodates extensional displacement between two or more non-collinear, large-scale normal faults within a rift system. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these zones are typically oriented obliquely to the main rift axis and are fundamental in controlling the location of structural highs. They consequently govern the preferential deposition and preservation of the microbial and coquina carbonate reservoir facies on these elevated features."
transitional environment,site,"The NLD defines a 'depositional setting' whose location is an 'intermediate position' relative to other geological features, which fits the definition of a site as an immaterial entity whose boundaries are determined by material entities.","A transitional environment is a depositional setting that occupies an intermediate position between high-energy, shallow lacustrine carbonate factories and low-energy, deep lacustrine depositional sinks. It is characterized by the lateral and vertical interfingering of reservoir-quality grainy carbonates with source- and seal-quality fine-grained sediments. This juxtaposition is fundamental to the development of the prolific Pre-Salt petroleum plays."

The resulting void space preserves the external shape and size of the original component, contributing significantly to reservoir storage capacity. This porosity type is a key feature in lacustrine facies, although its impact on permeability depends on the interconnection between the molds."
replacive,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines the term as an adjective describing a diagenetic process that modifies the composition and arrangement of a geological object.,"Replacive is an adjective describing a diagenetic process that involves the dissolution of a pre-existing mineral and the concurrent, volume-for-volume precipitation of a new mineral. This process is fundamental in the evolution of Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, where it commonly manifests as the dolomitization of primary calcite or aragonite microbial frameworks. The resulting texture can either preserve (mimetic) or obliterate the original depositional fabric, directly controlling the final porosity and permeability of the reservoir rock."
build-up,Depositional Unit,"The NLD describes it as a 'sedimentary body' and an 'accumulation' that forms a 'positive topographic feature', which fits the definition of a mappable Sedimentary Geological Object.","A build-up is a carbonate sedimentary body that is formed in situ within a lacustrine rift setting, primarily composed of microbially-influenced and chemically precipitated facies such as shrubs and spherulites. This accumulation results in a positive topographic feature that constitutes the primary reservoir interval of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."

This tectonic event establishes the transition from fault-controlled, syn-rift subsidence to a regional, thermally-driven post-rift sag. In the South Atlantic context, this sag phase created the broad, stable accommodation space necessary for the deposition of the extensive lacustrine microbial carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
igneous rock,Rock,"The NLD defines the term as a 'crystalline rock body', which fits the GeoCore definition of Rock as a solid, consolidated Earth Material.","An igneous rock is a crystalline rock body that is formed from the solidification of magma associated with South Atlantic rifting. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it constitutes the economic basement or occurs as intrusions and extrusions that compartmentalize carbonate reservoirs. These magmatic bodies significantly influence the petroleum system by creating barriers to fluid flow and providing localized heat sources for source rock maturation."
depositional process,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geological process that governs the accumulation of sedimentary material', which is a direct match to the GeoCore category definition.","A depositional process is a geological process that governs the accumulation of sedimentary material through physical, chemical, or biological means. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine systems, these processes are dominated by the in-situ biogenic and chemical precipitation of carbonates, such as microbialites and spherulites, from a highly alkaline water column.

In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process specifically focuses on delineating the rift-related fault network, the complex geometry of the salt layer, and the distribution of heterogeneous carbonate reservoir facies like coquinas and microbialites. It further involves the analysis of seismic attributes to infer rock properties and fluid contacts, thereby reducing uncertainty in petroleum system characterization."
hydrothermal alteration,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'diagenetic process' that modifies the composition and texture of rocks, which aligns with the definition of a Geological Process.","Hydrothermal alteration is a diagenetic process that modifies the mineralogical, chemical, and textural composition of carbonate reservoir rocks through interaction with hot, chemically reactive aqueous fluids. This metasomatic process typically results in the precipitation of authigenic magnesium-silicates, such as talc and stevensite, which replace the original rock fabric and occlude the pore system.

These factors directly controlled the genesis of the microbial carbonate factory and the preservation of the petroleum system's source rocks."
grain size,Dimension,"The NLD defines grain size as a property that quantifies the diameter of particles, which aligns with the definition of Dimension as a quality representing a one-dimensional extent.","Grain size is a fundamental textural property of a carbonate rock that quantifies the diameter of its constituent particles. In Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, this property, along with sorting and packing, is a primary control on the development of interparticle porosity and permeability. The classification of grain size ranges from clay and silt in microbial laminites to gravel-sized intraclasts in coquinas and breccias."
interparticle porosity,site,"The NLD defines the term as a 'void space between the constituent grains,' which aligns with the BFO definition of a site as a three-dimensional immaterial entity whose boundaries are determined by material entities.","Interparticle porosity is a type of primary porosity that represents the original void space between the constituent grains, crystals, or clasts of a sedimentary rock. In the lacustrine carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this porosity is fundamentally defined by the spaces between depositional components such as spherulites, microbial fragments, and bioclasts. This pore system forms the initial framework for hydrocarbon storage and fluid flow prior to significant diagenetic alteration."
sag stage,Geological Process,"The NLD describes this term as a 'phase of rift basin evolution' controlled by dynamic actions like 'thermal subsidence' and involving 'deposition', which are all types of geological processes.","The sag stage is a tectono-stratigraphic phase of rift basin evolution that follows the syn-rift and is primarily controlled by regional thermal subsidence rather than active faulting. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this subsidence created the widespread, low-gradient accommodation space necessary for the deposition of the prolific lacustrine carbonate reservoirs. This stage culminates with the deposition of the regional Aptian evaporites that form the critical top seal of the petroleum system."
talc,Earth Material,"The NLD describes talc as a 'clay mineral', which is a natural amount of solid matter generated by a geological process (diagenesis), fitting the definition of Earth Material.","Talc is an authigenic clay mineral that forms within Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates from the reaction of magnesium-rich fluids with siliceous precursors during diagenesis. Its precipitation within the pore network is a primary cause of reservoir quality degradation, as it occludes porosity and severely reduces permeability in the microbial facies."
rock type,Sedimentary Facies,"The NLD defines a rock type as a classification distinguished by a combination of depositional texture, fabric, and components, which aligns with the definition of a Sedimentary Facies as the sum of sedimentological characteristics.","A rock type is a fundamental classification of rock that is distinguished by a specific combination of depositional texture, fabric, and constituent components. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, these attributes directly control the initial pore system architecture and its subsequent diagenetic evolution. This classification is the primary input for building geological models used to predict reservoir quality and performance."
hydrocarbon exploration,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'multidisciplinary process' that integrates geological, geophysical, and geochemical methods to identify and characterize petroleum accumulations.","Hydrocarbon exploration is a multidisciplinary process that integrates geological, geophysical, and geochemical methods to identify, characterize, and de-risk potential petroleum accumulations. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is focused on imaging complex subsalt structures through advanced 3D seismic interpretation and validating petroleum system models. It culminates in the drilling of high-impact exploratory wells to confirm the presence of commercially viable volumes of oil and gas within lacustrine carbonate reservoirs."
production,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines production as a 'process' that moves reservoir fluids from the subsurface, which modifies the arrangement of a geological object (the reservoir).","Production is the process that brings reservoir fluids from a subsurface accumulation to the surface through a wellbore. This process is sustained over a period for the commercial recovery of hydrocarbons, distinguishing it from short-term well tests. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this involves managing the flow of oil, gas, and associated fluids like CO2 and formation water from complex carbonate reservoirs."
trap,Depositional System,"The NLD defines a trap as a 'geological configuration of reservoir and seal rocks', which fits the definition of a system composed of an aggregate of linked depositional units.","A trap is a geological configuration of reservoir and seal rocks that forms a subsurface closure capable of retaining migrating hydrocarbons. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt province, this configuration is predominantly a large structural closure in the sag-phase carbonates, often formed by halokinesis. The critical top seal is provided by the thick, overlying Aptian evaporite layer, which effectively contains the immense hydrocarbon columns."
relief,Dimension,"The NLD defines relief as a 'measure of the paleo-topographic variation,' which aligns with Dimension being a quality expressed as a numerical value representing a one-dimensional extent (in this case, vertical variation).","Relief is a measure of the paleo-topographic variation of a geological surface, typically the crystalline basement, that fundamentally controlled the accommodation space and facies distribution within the Pre-Salt lacustrine petroleum system. This inherited topography is a primary control on the location of both carbonate reservoir buildups on paleo-highs and organic-rich source rocks in paleo-lows."
alluvial fan,Depositional Unit,"The NLD describes it as a 'body of non-marine clastic sediment that is deposited in a characteristic fan or cone shape', which fits the definition of a recognizable sedimentary geological object.","An alluvial fan is a body of non-marine clastic sediment that is deposited in a characteristic fan or cone shape at the base of a high-relief escarpment, such as a rift border fault. In the syn-rift context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these deposits are sourced from the erosion of adjacent rift shoulders and form clastic wedges that interfinger with the coeval lacustrine depositional systems. They are typically composed of poorly sorted conglomerates and arkosic sandstones that can constitute secondary, yet significant, clastic reservoirs."
allochem,Geological Object,"The NLD defines an allochem as a 'discrete and recognizable carbonate grain,' which fits the definition of a Geological Object as a rigid entity that provides its own identity and unity criteria.","An allochem is a discrete and recognizable carbonate grain that has been transported from its site of origin prior to its final deposition. Within the lacustrine carbonate systems of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these grains are predominantly non-skeletal, such as spherulites, peloids, and intraclasts derived from reworked microbial substrates. The accumulation, size, and sorting of these allochems are fundamental controls on the primary porosity and permeability of the reservoir facies."
buildup,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines a buildup as a localized 'carbonate rock body' with 'positive topographic relief', which fits the definition of a Depositional Unit as a recognizable sedimentary geological object.","A buildup is a carbonate rock body that is a localized accumulation of microbialites, spherulites, and bioclasts, formed with positive topographic relief within the lacustrine sag section and constituting the primary reservoir of the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system. These geobodies are characterized by complex internal facies and a significant diagenetic overprint that creates high-porosity intervals."
conjugate margin,Geological Object,"The NLD defines a conjugate margin as a continental margin or geological province, which is a large-scale, rigid entity with its own identity criteria generated by geological processes like rifting.","A conjugate margin is a continental margin that was formerly adjacent to another margin before being separated by continental rifting and the subsequent formation of an ocean basin. This tectonic separation, such as the opening of the South Atlantic, creates mirrored geological provinces that often share analogous petroleum systems, including the Pre-Salt lacustrine carbonate successions found in Brazil and West Africa."
distal facies,Sedimentary Facies,"The NLD explicitly states that the term 'is a sedimentary facies' and describes the sum of its sedimentological characteristics, which directly aligns with the category definition.","A distal facies is a sedimentary facies that represents deposition in the lower-energy portions of a depositional system, situated far from the primary sediment source. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine setting, these facies are typically characterized by fine-grained, laminated carbonates and organic-rich mudstones deposited in the deeper, more central parts of the basin. Such facies are critical as they often constitute the primary source rocks and regional seals of the petroleum system."
dolomite rhomb,Geological Object,"The NLD defines the term as a 'crystal', which is explicitly listed as an example of a Geological Object, a rigid entity with its own identity and unity criteria.","A dolomite rhomb is an euhedral to subhedral crystal of the mineral dolomite that forms via diagenetic replacement or precipitation within a precursor carbonate rock. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt succession, these crystals are a fundamental component of reservoir rocks, where they pervasively replace microbial and coquina facies. The size, packing, and subsequent dissolution of these rhombs create the intercrystalline pore network that governs reservoir storage capacity and permeability."
geological record,Depositional System,"The NLD defines the term as a 'succession of rock strata, unconformities, and structural features', which fits the definition of a Depositional System as an aggregate of mereotopologically linked Depositional Units (strata).","A geological record is the succession of rock strata, unconformities, and structural features that provides the physical evidence for the tectonic, depositional, and diagenetic processes that governed the evolution of a sedimentary basin. It constitutes the primary dataset for interpreting the formation and preservation of petroleum system elements, particularly the lacustrine source rocks and microbial carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. The completeness of this record is often limited by non-deposition, erosion, and complex salt-related deformation."
intraparticle porosity,site,"The NLD defines the term as a type of pore space located within the boundaries of rock grains, which corresponds to the BFO definition of a site as an immaterial entity bounded by a material entity.","Intraparticle porosity is a type of pore space that is located within the boundaries of the individual constituent grains of a rock. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs, this porosity is a primary contributor to storage capacity and is characteristically found within the chambers of mollusk bioclasts and the internal fabric of microbial spherulites. This pore system's contribution to reservoir permeability is highly dependent on its connection to the interparticle pore network."
lacustrine system,Depositional System,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'continental depositional system' which comprises various depositional environments and their resulting deposits.,"A lacustrine system is a continental depositional system that, in the context of the South Atlantic rift, comprises the depositional environments of large, saline-alkaline, and chemically stratified lakes. This system is responsible for the coeval deposition of world-class, anoxic source rocks in profundal zones and unique, microbial to spherulitic carbonate reservoirs in littoral to sub-littoral zones. The interplay between tectonics, climate, and lake hydrochemistry controls the architecture and quality of these key petroleum system elements."
lamina,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines a lamina as a 'sedimentary layer,' which is a geological object constituted by sedimentary material, but it is too small to meet the scale requirement of a Depositional Unit.","A lamina is a millimeter-scale sedimentary layer that represents the smallest depositional unit within the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine successions, distinguished by a discrete composition of microbial mats, spherulites, or bioclasts."
microbial origin,quality,"The NLD defines the term as a 'genetic attribute of a geological material,' which directly corresponds to the BFO definition of a quality as a specifically dependent continuant that inheres in an independent continuant.","Microbial origin is a genetic attribute of a geological material that results from the metabolic activities of microorganisms. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, this attribute primarily describes carbonate rocks whose framework was built by microbial communities that induced mineral precipitation or trapped and bound sediment particles. These processes are fundamental to the formation of the highly heterogeneous microbialite facies that constitute the main petroleum reservoirs."
microcrystalline quartz,Earth Material,"The NLD defines the term as a solid, natural 'aggregate of interlocking crystals' (a type of matter) formed by a diagenetic geological process.","Microcrystalline quartz is a textural variety of quartz that consists of an aggregate of interlocking crystals resolvable only under a microscope. Within Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, it is a common authigenic mineral that forms via the diagenetic replacement of precursor carbonates, significantly altering the original rock fabric and pore system. Its precipitation is typically associated with silica-rich fluids active during the sag phase."
oncoid,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines an oncoid as a 'coated carbonate grain,' which is a discrete physical entity constituted by sedimentary material.","An oncoid is a coated carbonate grain that is formed by the microbial accretion of irregular, concentric laminae around a nucleus. These grains are fundamental components of the high-porosity lacustrine grainstone and rudstone reservoir facies characteristic of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
slope,Geological Boundary,"The NLD defines a slope as a physiographic element that connects two areas (platform and basin floor), which functions as an external surface, fitting the definition of a Geological Boundary.","A slope is a physiographic element of a lacustrine carbonate depositional system that connects the higher-energy platform margin to the deeper, lower-energy basin floor. It is characterized by a distinct topographic gradient where gravity-driven processes, such as debris flows and grain flows, transport and redeposit carbonate sediments. These resedimented deposits, often forming clastic aprons of breccias and grainstones, constitute significant reservoir facies in the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
volcanic fragment,Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as a 'rock clast,' which is a rigid, discrete entity with its own identity and unity, formed by the geological process of fragmentation.","A volcanic fragment is a rock clast that is derived from the fragmentation of syn-rift volcanic rocks and incorporated as an allochthonous component within Pre-Salt lacustrine successions, where its diagenetic alteration impacts reservoir quality."
aggradation,Geological Process,"The NLD defines aggradation as the 'vertical accumulation' and 'formation' of deposits, which is a process that generates geological objects over time.","Aggradation is a stratal stacking pattern that describes the predominantly vertical accumulation of carbonate deposits, such as microbialites and coquinas, within a lacustrine rift basin. This pattern occurs when the rate of in-situ carbonate production is balanced by the rate of accommodation created by tectonic subsidence and lake-level rise. It results in the formation of thick, vertically stacked successions that can constitute significant reservoir intervals."
amplitude,quality,"The NLD defines amplitude as a seismic attribute that quantifies the magnitude of a reflection event, which aligns with the definition of a quality as a measurable property that inheres in an entity.","Amplitude is a fundamental seismic attribute that quantifies the magnitude of a reflection event recorded on a seismic trace. This value is primarily controlled by the acoustic impedance contrast across a geological interface, such as the boundary between evaporites and the underlying microbial carbonate reservoirs. Variations in amplitude are therefore critical for mapping reservoir boundaries, faults, and internal diagenetic heterogeneities within the Brazilian Pre-Salt section."
crustal thinning,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'tectonic process' that involves the vertical reduction of a geological object, the Earth's crust.","Crustal thinning is a tectonic process that involves the vertical reduction of the Earth's crust in response to extensional forces. This process governed the South Atlantic rifting, creating the fundamental accommodation space for the deposition of the Brazilian Pre-Salt sag phase, including its prolific source rocks and carbonate reservoirs. The associated asthenospheric upwelling resulted in an elevated geothermal gradient, which was critical for the maturation of the petroleum system."
drift,Depositional Unit,"The NLD describes the drift as a large-scale 'tectono-stratigraphic supersequence' constituted by deposited marine sediments, which aligns with the definition of a mappable Sedimentary Geological Object.","A drift is a tectono-stratigraphic supersequence that represents the post-rift thermal subsidence stage of the South Atlantic passive margin. It is characterized by the deposition of open marine sediments, such as shales and marls, which unconformably overlie the Pre-Salt sag sequence. This succession typically contains the regional seal rocks that trap hydrocarbons within the underlying Pre-Salt reservoirs."
halokinesis,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geological process' involving the 'subsurface flow' and 'movement' of salt, which modifies the arrangement of geological objects.","Halokinesis is a geological process that describes the subsurface flow of evaporitic sequences, such as the Aptian salt, driven by their low density and ductility under differential sedimentary loading. This salt movement is a primary control on the formation of structural traps and the architecture of underlying pre-salt carbonate reservoirs. The process results in complex geometries including salt walls, diapirs, and welds that influence hydrocarbon migration and accumulation."
hanging wall,Geological Object,"The NLD defines a hanging wall as a 'fault block,' which is a rigid, unified entity generated by a geological process, fitting the definition of a Geological Object.","A hanging wall is the fault block that is positioned above an inclined fault plane. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this block is down-thrown during rifting and typically contains the syn-rift lacustrine source rocks. The resulting half-graben accommodation space is subsequently filled and sealed by the Aptian evaporite sequence."
high-energy environment,Geological Process,"The NLD defines the term by the dominant geological actions occurring within it, such as 'persistent wave action sufficient to rework, sort, and transport carbonate grains,' which are types of geological processes.","A high-energy environment is a lacustrine depositional setting that is dominated by persistent wave action sufficient to rework, sort, and transport carbonate grains. This process leads to the accumulation of grain-supported deposits, such as coquinas and spherulitic grainstones. These well-sorted facies typically form the highest quality reservoir intervals within the Brazilian Pre-Salt succession."
lithosphere,Geological Object,"The NLD defines the lithosphere as a 'rigid outer mechanical layer of the Earth', which aligns with the definition of a Geological Object as a rigid entity with its own identity criteria, exemplified by tectonic plates.","The lithosphere is the rigid outer mechanical layer of the Earth that comprises the crust and the uppermost mantle, governing large-scale tectonics through its brittle-elastic response to stress. The extensional thinning of the continental lithosphere during the breakup of Gondwana dictated the architecture of the rift basins and the elevated geothermal gradient required for the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system. Subsequent thermal subsidence of this thinned lithosphere created the accommodation space for the thick sag and evaporite sequences."
oil accumulation,Earth Fluid,"The NLD defines the term as a 'discrete body of crude oil,' which directly corresponds to the Earth Fluid category representing a volume of fluid like oil.","An oil accumulation is a discrete body of crude oil that has migrated from a source rock and is held by a trapping mechanism within the pore space of a reservoir rock. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these accumulations are characteristically found in lacustrine carbonate reservoirs, such as microbialites and coquinas, sourced from organic-rich shales and sealed by a thick overlying evaporite sequence. The traps are typically large, combined structural-stratigraphic features related to rift-phase horst blocks."
reservoir characteristic,quality,"The NLD defines the term as a 'property' (e.g., porosity, permeability) that inheres in a reservoir, which aligns with the BFO definition of a quality as a specifically dependent continuant.","A reservoir characteristic is a geological, petrophysical, or geochemical property that governs the capacity of a reservoir to store, transmit, and produce fluids. Such properties, including porosity, permeability, fluid saturation, and fracture network geometry, are defined at multiple scales from pore to field. Their integrated characterization is critical for quantifying hydrocarbon volumes and predicting dynamic reservoir performance."
salt tectonics,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'set of geological deformational processes' that modifies the architecture of geological bodies, which is the definition of a Geological Process.","Salt tectonics is a set of geological deformational processes that is driven by the density contrast and viscous flow of a thick evaporite layer in response to differential loading by overlying sediments. In the Brazilian continental margin, this halokinesis governs the post-rift architecture, creating complex allochthonous salt bodies, welds, and intervening depocenters known as minibasins. These salt-related structures are critical elements of the Pre-Salt petroleum system, providing the ultimate regional seal and forming the large structural traps for the underlying carbonate reservoirs."
seismic pattern,Facies,"The NLD defines the term as a 'distinct and recognizable configuration of seismic reflections' which is a visual pattern used to interpret properties of geological objects, aligning with the definition of Facies.","A seismic pattern is a distinct and recognizable configuration of seismic reflections that is interpreted to represent a specific depositional environment, structural style, or lithofacies association based on its geometry and reflector characteristics. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, mounded and chaotic internal reflection patterns are diagnostic of microbial carbonate buildups, whereas sub-parallel, high-continuity reflectors characterize the sag-phase lacustrine source rocks."
seismic resolution,quality,"The NLD defines the term as a 'measure' and a 'property' that quantifies the ability to distinguish features, which aligns with the BFO definition of a quality as a specifically dependent continuant.","Seismic resolution is a measure that quantifies the minimum separation at which two adjacent geological features can be distinguished on a seismic dataset. This property is critical in the Brazilian Pre-Salt for imaging the boundaries of complex carbonate reservoirs, such as microbialite buildups and coquinas, located beneath the thick, signal-attenuating salt canopy. The resolving power is fundamentally limited by the seismic signal's wavelength."
chert,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines chert as a 'microcrystalline siliceous rock' formed through diagenesis, which directly aligns with the definition of a Sedimentary Rock.","Chert is a microcrystalline siliceous rock that forms primarily through the diagenetic replacement of precursor carbonate minerals within the lacustrine successions of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its occurrence as nodules, cements, or pervasive silicified bodies significantly alters original reservoir properties by reducing matrix porosity and permeability. However, due to its brittle nature, chert-rich intervals are prone to fracturing, which can create essential secondary permeability pathways in otherwise tight reservoir zones."
conglomerate,Sedimentary Rock,The NLD explicitly defines the term as 'a clastic sedimentary rock' composed of cemented clasts within a matrix.,"A conglomerate is a clastic sedimentary rock that is composed of predominantly rounded to sub-rounded, gravel-sized clasts (>2 mm in diameter) cemented within a finer-grained matrix. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these deposits typically form as either siliciclastic fanglomerates sourced from rift-margin fault scarps or as carbonate rudstones resulting from the high-energy reworking of microbial buildups and coquinas. They can constitute significant reservoir facies, particularly where primary interparticle porosity is preserved or enhanced by dissolution."
desiccation,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines desiccation as a 'diagenetic process' that modifies a geological object (sediment) by removing water and creating fracture systems.,"Desiccation is an early diagenetic process that results from the removal of pore water and subsequent shrinkage of sediment following subaerial exposure. In the lacustrine carbonate successions of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process forms polygonal crack networks in microbialites and mudstones, which act as critical indicators of lake-level fall and can create fracture systems that enhance reservoir permeability."
isotope analysis,process,"The NLD describes this term as an 'analytical method' which is a series of actions that unfold over time, fitting the BFO definition of a process.","Isotope analysis is an analytical method that quantifies the relative abundance of isotopes of specific elements within geological materials. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is principally applied to carbonate reservoirs, source rocks, and fluids to constrain chemostratigraphy, reconstruct diagenetic histories, and trace the origin and migration of hydrocarbons. This method is critical for understanding the unique lacustrine depositional systems and subsequent fluid-rock interactions that define these reservoirs."
carbonate factory,Depositional System,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'depositional system', which is a direct match for the GeoReservoir category.","A carbonate factory is a depositional system that generates carbonate sediments in situ through biological and/or physicochemical processes. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these factories operated in restricted, alkaline lacustrine to transitional settings, dominated by microbial communities and the direct precipitation of calcium carbonate spherulites. The resulting deposits form the primary source material for the highly complex microbialite and grainstone reservoirs of the sag-phase succession."
deformation,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geological process that modifies the original shape, size, or orientation of rock bodies,' which directly matches the definition of a Geological Process.","Deformation is a geological process that modifies the original shape, size, or orientation of rock bodies in response to tectonic stresses, resulting in the formation of geological structures. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is primarily driven by continental rifting and subsequent halokinesis of the Aptian salt layer. These resultant structures, including horsts, faulted blocks, and salt-induced anticlines, form the primary structural traps and fracture networks that control hydrocarbon accumulations in the carbonate reservoirs."
downlap,Geological Contact,"The NLD defines downlap as a termination where inclined strata meet a lower surface, which is a relational quality describing the contact between two geological objects.","Downlap is a baselap termination in which initially inclined strata terminate downdip against a less inclined or horizontal lower surface, such as a sequence boundary. This pattern represents sediment progradation and is a primary indicator of the basinward extent of depositional systems. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is critical for delineating the geometry of prograding carbonate reservoir bodies like coquina banks and microbial buildups."
erosional truncation,Geological Contact,"The NLD defines the term as a 'stratigraphic termination' where rock layers are 'cut off by an overlying surface,' which describes a specific type of contact relationship between two adjacent geological objects or units.","Erosional truncation is a stratigraphic termination that occurs where underlying, typically tilted, rock layers are cut off by an overlying surface of erosion, known as an unconformity. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this feature commonly defines the upper boundary of syn-rift carbonate reservoirs beneath the base-of-salt unconformity. This geometry is a critical element in forming stratigraphic traps, where porous reservoir facies are terminated against overlying sealing rocks."
extension,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'tectonic process' that causes deformation and modification of the lithosphere.,"Extension is a tectonic process that causes the stretching and thinning of the continental lithosphere through normal faulting. This deformation created the South Atlantic rift system, generating the horst and graben architecture that controlled the deposition and preservation of the Pre-Salt petroleum system elements. The resulting structural highs form the primary traps for the vast microbial carbonate reservoirs."
fault reactivation,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'tectonic process' that involves renewed slip, which modifies the arrangement of geological objects.","Fault reactivation is a tectonic process that involves renewed slip along a pre-existing fault or structural weakness in response to a change in the orientation or magnitude of the regional stress field. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this mechanism is critical for controlling the structural framework of the sag-phase carbonate reservoirs, often by reactivating basement faults from the Gondwana rift phase. Such reactivation influences reservoir compartmentalization, the development of fracture networks, and the pathways for hydrocarbon migration and charge."
fault block,Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as a 'crustal block,' a rigid entity with its own identity and unity created by a geological process (faulting), which aligns with the definition of a Geological Object.","A fault block is a crustal block that is bounded by major rift-related normal faults and has undergone vertical and/or rotational displacement relative to adjacent blocks. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these blocks form the fundamental structural framework of the syn-rift section. The elevated blocks (horsts) create paleohighs for the development of carbonate reservoirs, while the down-dropped blocks (grabens) form depocenters for lacustrine source rocks."
feldspar,Earth Material,"The NLD describes feldspar as a group of rock-forming minerals that is a primary constituent of rocks, which fits the definition of Earth Material as a natural amount of matter that constitutes geological objects.","Feldspar is a group of rock-forming tectosilicate minerals that is a primary constituent of the crystalline basement and a significant detrital component within syn-rift siliciclastic sequences of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its alteration products, primarily clay minerals, are fundamental to the composition of the prolific lacustrine source and seal rocks. This makes it a critical mineral for understanding the complete petroleum system, from provenance to the formation of source and seal facies."
lacustrine setting,Depositional System,"The NLD describes a large-scale lake system that encompasses various deposits like carbonates and shales, fitting the definition of an aggregate of linked depositional units.","A lacustrine setting is a continental depositional environment that, in the Brazilian Pre-Salt, corresponds to a large-scale, saline-alkaline lake system developed within a rift basin. This environment is characterized by the prolific development of microbial and bioclastic carbonates, which form the main reservoirs. It also encompasses the deposition of the organic-rich shales that constitute the primary source rocks of the petroleum system."
magmatic,Geological Age,"The NLD defines 'magmatic' as a characteristic indicating an origin from a specific geological process (cooling of molten rock), which aligns with Geological Age as a quality related to the process that generated an object.","Magmatic is a characteristic of a geological material or process that indicates an origin from the cooling and crystallization of molten rock. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this term primarily describes the mafic igneous intrusions and extrusions emplaced during the South Atlantic rifting. These igneous bodies critically influence reservoir quality, thermal maturity, and seismic imaging within the petroleum system."
stratigraphic framework,generically dependent continuant,"The NLD defines the term as a 'conceptual geological model' used to organize information, which aligns with the definition of a generically dependent continuant as an informational pattern or content that can have multiple copies, like a blueprint.","A stratigraphic framework is a conceptual geological model that organizes sedimentary successions into a predictive spatial and temporal arrangement based on genetically related depositional units bounded by chronostratigraphically significant surfaces. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this model is essential for delineating the architecture of syn-rift to sag-phase sequences, including the distribution of lacustrine source rocks, microbialite and coquina reservoirs, and the regional evaporitic seal. The framework integrates seismic, well, and core data to establish correlations and constrain the geometry of petroleum system elements across the basin."
syn-deposition fault,Geological Structure,"The NLD defines a fault by its control on the architecture and arrangement of strata, which fits the definition of a Geological Structure as the configuration and mutual relationships of a Geological Object's parts.","A syn-deposition fault is a fault that exhibits displacement contemporaneous with the accumulation of adjacent sedimentary strata. Its activity creates accommodation space, characteristically causing stratigraphic expansion in the hanging wall and potential thinning or onlap onto the footwall. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these extensional faults are fundamental controls on the architecture and heterogeneity of the lacustrine carbonate reservoir systems."
tectonic setting,Geological Process,"The NLD describes it as a geodynamic environment resulting from the 'interaction of lithospheric plates,' which is a large-scale process that generates and modifies geological objects like sedimentary basins.","A tectonic setting is a geodynamic environment that is characterized by the specific stress regime and structural architecture resulting from the interaction of lithospheric plates. This environment fundamentally governs the genesis and evolution of sedimentary basins, controlling the development and distribution of key petroleum system elements. It dictates the creation of accommodation space for deposition, such as the grabens that hosted the Pre-Salt lacustrine source rocks and carbonate reservoirs."
accommodation,site,"The NLD defines accommodation as 'the geological space available for sediment accumulation,' which corresponds to the BFO definition of a site as a three-dimensional immaterial entity whose boundaries are determined in relation to material entities.","Accommodation is the geological space available for sediment accumulation that is primarily controlled by the interplay between tectonic subsidence and lacustrine base-level fluctuations. The relationship between the rate of accommodation creation and the rate of carbonate production governs the stratigraphic architecture and facies distribution of reservoir units. Consequently, variations in accommodation directly influence the development, preservation, and vertical stacking patterns of microbial and coquina carbonate reservoirs."
stratigraphic architecture,Sedimentary Structure,"The NLD describes a 'three-dimensional framework' of depositional sequences, which aligns with the definition of a Sedimentary Structure as a pattern of the internal arrangement of Depositional Units.","Stratigraphic architecture is the three-dimensional framework of genetically related depositional sequences that defines the geometry, spatial distribution, and connectivity of rock bodies. This framework results from the interplay of tectonics, base-level changes, and sediment supply. It ultimately controls the distribution and quality of reservoir facies, such as the lacustrine carbonates of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, within a petroleum system."
fragment,Geological Object,"The NLD defines a fragment as a 'carbonate clast,' which is a discrete, rigid entity with its own identity, generated by a geological process of mechanical breakdown.","A fragment is a carbonate clast that is derived from the mechanical breakdown of pre-existing, syn-depositional materials within the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine system. These clasts are commonly composed of microbialite, spherulite, or mollusc shell material. Their accumulation forms high-energy deposits such as rudstones and breccias, where interparticle porosity can constitute significant reservoir volume."
chemical precipitate,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD describes a crystalline solid formed by chemical precipitation that is fundamental to the formation of reservoir facies, which are characteristics of a sedimentary rock.","A chemical precipitate is a crystalline solid that forms by direct nucleation from a supersaturated aqueous solution due to changes in its physicochemical conditions. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is fundamental to the formation of carbonate reservoir facies from lacustrine brines, where supersaturation is primarily driven by evaporation and microbially-mediated changes in water chemistry."
hydrocarbon accumulation,Earth Fluid,"The NLD defines the term as a 'discrete subsurface body of movable petroleum,' which directly aligns with the definition of Earth Fluid as a volume of fluid such as oil or gas.","A hydrocarbon accumulation is a discrete subsurface body of movable petroleum that is confined within a geological trap formed by a reservoir and an overlying seal. This trap prevents the upward migration of hydrocarbons, allowing them to collect in potentially economic quantities. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt province, these accumulations are predominantly found in large structural highs involving lacustrine carbonate reservoirs sealed by thick evaporite sequences."
hydrothermal process,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'diagenetic process' that alters rock fabric, which directly corresponds to the definition of a Geological Process that modifies a Geological Object.","A hydrothermal process is a diagenetic process driven by the circulation of heated, chemically reactive aqueous fluids that profoundly alters the primary rock fabric through mineral dissolution, precipitation, and replacement. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is frequently linked to Aptian magmatism and rift-related high heat flow, mobilizing fluids that interact with the carbonate and evaporite sequences. This interaction is a primary control on reservoir quality, creating extreme heterogeneity by forming both high-permeability conduits and cemented barriers."
pore system,site,"The NLD describes a 'three-dimensional network of voids within a rock,' which is an immaterial entity whose boundaries are defined by the surrounding material rock, fitting the definition of a site.","A pore system is a three-dimensional network of voids within a rock that governs the storage (porosity) and flow (permeability) of fluids through its interconnected pores, vugs, and fractures. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, this network is exceptionally complex, resulting from intense diagenetic overprinting of primary depositional fabrics such as coquinas and microbialites. The architecture of this system is the primary control on reservoir quality and hydrocarbon producibility."
primary porosity,site,"The NLD defines the term as a 'class of pore space' and 'voids' within a rock, which corresponds to an immaterial entity whose boundaries are determined by a material entity.","Primary porosity is a class of pore space that is created during the deposition of sediments or during eodiagenesis, and is therefore inherent to the original rock fabric. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, it encompasses interparticle voids between spherulites or bioclasts, intraparticle voids within bivalve shells, and growth-framework or fenestral voids in microbialites. This initial pore system provides the fundamental template upon which subsequent diagenetic processes, such as dissolution and cementation, act to modify the reservoir quality."
pyrite,Earth Material,"The NLD defines pyrite as an 'iron sulfide mineral,' which is a type of natural, solid matter generated by geological processes, fitting the definition of Earth Material.","Pyrite is an iron sulfide mineral (FeS₂) that is a common authigenic phase within the lacustrine source and reservoir rocks of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its formation is primarily associated with bacterial sulfate reduction in anoxic depositional and early diagenetic environments, making it a key indicator for the preservation potential of organic matter. Within reservoir facies, it typically occurs as disseminated crystals or framboids, reflecting localized reducing conditions during diagenesis."
sedimentology,process,"The NLD defines sedimentology as a discipline that 'investigates the processes of formation, transport, deposition, and diagenesis,' which is an occurrent that unfolds over time.","Sedimentology is a geoscience discipline that investigates the processes of formation, transport, deposition, and diagenesis of sediments and sedimentary rocks. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it focuses on the characterization of non-marine carbonate facies, such as microbialites and spherulites, to interpret their unique lacustrine depositional systems. This interpretation is critical for building predictive models of reservoir architecture, distribution, and quality."
syngenetic precipitate,Earth Material,"The NLD defines this as a 'mineral phase' that forms 'an integral part of the primary rock fabric', which fits the definition of Earth Material as a natural amount of matter that constitutes a geological object like a rock.","A syngenetic precipitate is a mineral phase that crystallizes directly from the depositional water column or pore fluids contemporaneously with the accumulation of the surrounding sediment. In the lacustrine carbonate systems of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these precipitates, such as microbially-mediated calcite or early magnesite, form an integral part of the primary rock fabric. Their formation is a key process that controls the initial reservoir quality by creating or occluding primary porosity."
wave,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines a wave as a 'hydrodynamic process' responsible for the transport, sorting, and reworking of sediments, which aligns with the definition of a Geological Process.","A wave is a surface water oscillation that transfers energy, typically from wind, across the surface of a fluid body. Within the lacustrine systems of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this hydrodynamic process was the primary agent for the transport, sorting, and reworking of carbonate sediments. This action directly controlled the development of reservoir facies architecture and quality."
gypsum,Earth Material,"The NLD defines gypsum as a mineral, which is a type of natural, solid matter generated by a geological process (precipitation), fitting the definition of an Earth Material.","Gypsum is a hydrated calcium sulfate evaporite mineral that precipitates from hypersaline brines in restricted depositional environments. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is a primary constituent of the Aptian evaporite succession, which acts as the regional top seal for the underlying carbonate reservoirs. During burial, it commonly dehydrates to form anhydrite, a process critical to understanding the geomechanical properties and sealing integrity of the salt layer."
wave action,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'physical sedimentary process' that reworks, abrades, and sorts sediments, which aligns with the definition of a Geological Process.","Wave action is a physical sedimentary process that reworks, abrades, and sorts unconsolidated lacustrine carbonate sediments within the zone of influence above the wave base. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is a primary control on the deposition of high-energy, grain-supported facies, such as coquinas and spherulitic grainstones. These well-sorted facies form the highest quality reservoirs by winnowing mud and creating effective interparticle porosity."
vertical resolution,quality,"The NLD defines the term as an 'ability' and a 'property' of a geophysical dataset, which aligns with the BFO definition of a quality as a characteristic that inheres in a bearer.","Vertical resolution is the ability of a geophysical dataset to distinguish between two closely spaced geological interfaces in the vertical dimension. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this property dictates the minimum thickness of a carbonate reservoir layer, such as a coquina, that can be individually resolved from seismic reflection or well log data. It is fundamentally limited by the dominant frequency of the seismic wavelet or the physical design of the logging instrument."
accumulation,Earth Fluid,"The NLD defines an accumulation as a discrete body of petroleum, which is a type of Earth Fluid.","An accumulation is a discrete body of petroleum that is confined within a subsurface geological trap. It is characterized by a common pressure system and is defined by a hydrocarbon-water contact. This entrapment results from the juxtaposition of a porous and permeable reservoir, such as the Pre-Salt microbial carbonates, against a sealing rock that intercepts the hydrocarbon migration pathway."
geochemistry,process,"The NLD defines geochemistry as a branch of science that involves activities like investigating, characterizing, and quantifying, which are all types of processes that unfold over time.","Geochemistry is a branch of geoscience that investigates the chemical composition, distribution, and isotopic signatures of Earth materials. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is fundamentally applied to characterize the organic matter of lacustrine source rocks, correlate hydrocarbons to their source, and quantify the diagenetic processes controlling the evolution of carbonate reservoir quality. This discipline provides critical data for defining the petroleum system and predicting fluid properties."
subaerial exposure,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geological process' that modifies carbonate deposits by creating porosity and karst features.,"Subaerial exposure is a geological process that subjects previously submerged carbonate deposits to atmospheric conditions due to a relative fall in base level. This process initiates meteoric diagenesis, which is critical for creating secondary porosity and extensive karst features through dissolution. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these exposure events are a primary control on reservoir quality, creating high-permeability conduits and vuggy porosity systems within the Aptian microbialite and coquina facies."
tectonic evolution,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geological process' and describes a sequence of events that generate and modify geological objects, which directly matches the GeoCore category definition.","Tectonic evolution is a geological process that describes the sequence of crustal deformation events, from the continental rifting of Gondwana to the subsequent sag and drift phases, that governed the formation and architecture of the South Atlantic passive margin basins. This process directly controlled the creation of accommodation space for the deposition of pre-salt source rocks and carbonate reservoirs. Furthermore, it established the thermal regime for hydrocarbon generation and the formation of structural traps sealed by the Aptian salt."
in situ deposit,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines the term as a 'carbonate sedimentary body' formed by components that accumulated at their final depositional site, which fits the definition of a recognizable sedimentary geological object.","An in situ deposit is a carbonate sedimentary body that is constituted by components which grew, accumulated, or precipitated at their final site of deposition without significant subsequent transport. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine reservoirs, this primarily includes microbialites, such as stromatolites and thrombolites, and autochthonous coquinas. These deposits form key reservoir facies where the original depositional fabric strongly influences porosity and permeability."
mud,Sediment,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'fine-grained carbonate sediment', which directly aligns with the GeoReservoir category for an unconsolidated earth material.",Mud is a fine-grained carbonate sediment that is composed of microcrystalline calcite originating from microbial and/or inorganic precipitation within the Pre-Salt's alkaline lacustrine depositional system. This material constitutes the primary matrix for the reservoir facies and is a key component of the organic-rich source rock intervals. Its distribution is a fundamental control on the petrophysical properties and heterogeneity of the reservoir.
oil field,Depositional System,"The NLD defines an oil field as an accumulation of a single or multiple spatially related reservoirs, which fits the definition of a system as an aggregate of linked depositional units.","An oil field is a petroleum accumulation that consists of a single reservoir, or multiple spatially related reservoirs, containing hydrocarbons that are predominantly crude oil and can be produced commercially."
reservoir property,quality,"The NLD defines it as a quantifiable attribute of a rock (e.g., porosity, permeability), which is a quality that inheres in and specifically depends on a material entity.","A reservoir property is a quantifiable petrophysical or geological attribute of a rock that defines its capacity to store and transmit fluids. These properties, such as porosity, permeability, and water saturation, are fundamental for assessing hydrocarbon volumes and producibility. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, their values and distribution are heterogeneously controlled by the complex interplay between depositional facies and multi-stage diagenesis in carbonate successions."
cementstone,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'crystalline carbonate rock' formed by precipitation, which is a type of sedimentary process.","A cementstone is a crystalline carbonate rock that is supported by its cement framework, in which original depositional components are not in contact. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this fabric is characteristically composed of primary or early diagenetic calcite cements, such as spherulites, precipitated directly from the alkaline lacustrine water column. This rock type can form significant reservoir intervals when intercrystalline or vuggy porosity is preserved between the cement crystals."
displacive,Sedimentary Facies,"The NLD defines the term as a textural attribute describing the fabric of a sedimentary rock, which aligns with the definition of Sedimentary Facies as a visual pattern of sedimentological characteristics.","Displacive is a textural attribute that describes an authigenic mineral that has grown within a pre-existing sedimentary fabric, physically forcing apart and deforming the host components. This process is common in Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, where evaporite minerals such as halite grow within microbialite or coquina facies. The resulting texture is distinct from pore-filling cementation or fabric-replacive textures."
fascicular-optic calcite,Sedimentary Facies,"The NLD defines the term as a specific ""crystal habit"" and ""fabric"" with characteristic visual and optical properties, which aligns with the definition of a Sedimentary Facies as a sum of sedimentological characteristics.","Fascicular-optic calcite is a primary, abiogenic calcite crystal habit that is composed of radiating, fan-like bundles of fibrous to bladed sub-crystals which exhibit sweeping undulose extinction under cross-polarized light. This fabric is characteristic of precipitation from the highly alkaline and silica-rich lacustrine waters typical of the Brazilian Pre-Salt sag phase. It constitutes the fundamental framework-building component of microbialite and spherulitic grainstone reservoirs, where its growth fabric dictates the primary intercrystalline porosity."
lacustrine coquina,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'bioclastic carbonate rock' constituted by accumulated shells and fragments, which fits the definition of a rock made from sedimentary particles.","A lacustrine coquina is a bioclastic carbonate rock that is predominantly composed of reworked and accumulated shells and fragments of endemic lacustrine bivalves and gastropods. It is deposited in high-energy, shallow-water lake margin settings, such as shoals and shorefaces, characteristic of the Aptian sag phase in the Santos and Campos basins. Subsequent diagenesis, particularly the dissolution of aragonitic bioclasts, often creates high-porosity and high-permeability intervals, forming the most significant petroleum reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
lake margin,site,"The NLD defines this term as a 'transitional depositional setting' and a 'zone', which corresponds to a three-dimensional immaterial entity whose location is determined in relation to other material entities.","A lake margin is a transitional depositional setting that separates a lacustrine domain from adjacent subaerial or fluvial environments. Within the sag phase of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it represents a high-energy, wave-agitated zone characterized by the development of prolific microbial and bioclastic carbonate factories. These factories are responsible for the accumulation of key reservoir facies, including coquina shoals and stromatolitic buildups."
layer,Depositional Unit,"The NLD describes a 'layer' as a distinct stratigraphic rock unit bounded by surfaces, corresponding to a depositional facies, which fits the definition of a recognizable Sedimentary Geological Object.","A layer is a tabular to lenticular stratigraphic rock unit that is characterized by a set of relatively homogeneous lithological, sedimentological, and petrophysical properties distinct from those in adjacent units. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, such a unit typically corresponds to a specific depositional facies, like a microbialite or coquina body, which forms a fundamental element for reservoir characterization. The unit is bounded by surfaces that represent a significant change in depositional energy or environment."
microbial mat,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as an 'organosedimentary structure' and a 'primary depositional fabric' formed by trapping, binding, and precipitating minerals, which fits the definition of a geological object constituted by sedimentary material.","A microbial mat is an organosedimentary structure that is formed by layered benthic microbial communities which trap, bind, and/or induce the precipitation of carbonate minerals. It represents a primary depositional fabric that constitutes key source and reservoir facies within the lacustrine successions of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
microcrystalline silica,Earth Material,"The NLD defines it as a diagenetic mineral composed of quartz crystals that acts as a cement, fitting the description of a natural, solid amount of matter generated by a geological process.","Microcrystalline silica is a diagenetic mineral, composed of microscopic quartz crystals, that commonly replaces precursor carbonate minerals or precipitates as a pore-filling cement within the lacustrine reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its precipitation is often driven by pH fluctuations in alkaline lacustrine settings, mobilizing silica from sources such as volcaniclastics, clay minerals, or biogenic components. This silicification process typically results in a significant reduction of reservoir porosity and permeability, acting as a major control on reservoir quality distribution."
sedimentary structure,Sedimentary Structure,"The NLD describes a 'macroscopic geometric feature that is formed within a sediment', which aligns perfectly with the category definition of a pattern of internal arrangement within Depositional Units.","A sedimentary structure is a macroscopic geometric feature that is formed within a sediment at or near the time of deposition by physical, chemical, or biological processes. These features are preserved upon lithification and serve as primary indicators of depositional processes, hydrodynamic energy, and paleoenvironmental conditions. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, key examples include microbial laminations and shrub fabrics that indicate biogenic influence, and graded bedding in coquinas that signifies high-energy depositional events."
silica precipitation,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'diagenetic process' that modifies the composition of a geological object by forming new minerals.,"Silica precipitation is a diagenetic process that results in the formation of authigenic silica minerals from pore fluids. Within the lacustrine carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it primarily occurs as chert or microcrystalline quartz that replaces carbonate constituents and cements primary and secondary porosity. This process is a major control on reservoir quality degradation, creating low-permeability barriers and significantly reducing hydrocarbon storage capacity."
spherulitestone,Sedimentary Rock,The definition explicitly identifies the term as a 'non-skeletal carbonate rock that is composed predominantly of spherulites'.,"A spherulitestone is a non-skeletal carbonate rock that is composed predominantly of spherulites. These spherulites are typically radial aggregates of calcite crystals interpreted to have precipitated abiotically or with microbial influence from the supersaturated alkaline waters of a lacustrine system. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this facies constitutes significant reservoir intervals characterized by high primary interparticle porosity."
stylolite,Geological Boundary,"The NLD describes a stylolite as a 'planar diagenetic feature' that forms a 'barrier', which fits the definition of a physical discontinuity within a rock mass.","A stylolite is a planar diagenetic feature that results from pressure-dissolution and chemical compaction within a rock mass. It is characterized by an irregular, serrated geometry along which insoluble materials, including clays and solid bitumen, accumulate. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, these features commonly form extensive, low-permeability barriers that create significant reservoir compartmentalization."
vertical growth,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly describes the term as a 'depositional style' and a 'process' that results in the formation of carbonate reservoirs, which directly aligns with the definition of a Geological Process.","Vertical growth is a depositional style of carbonate buildups that is dominated by upward aggradation, resulting in vertically stacked facies. This process occurs when the rate of carbonate production, typically from microbial or shelly communities, equals or exceeds the rate of accommodation space creation from relative water level rise. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this style is fundamental to the formation of thick, high-quality lacustrine carbonate reservoirs with significant vertical connectivity."
vug,site,"The NLD defines a vug as a 'secondary pore' within a rock, which directly corresponds to the BFO category 'site', a three-dimensional immaterial entity (a hole) whose boundaries are determined by a surrounding material entity.","A vug is a secondary pore within a carbonate reservoir that is substantially larger than the rock's fabric-forming components, such as spherulites or microbial shrubs. It is created by the localized dissolution of more soluble minerals, with boundaries that typically cut across the primary depositional fabric. This pore type is a critical contributor to the development of high-permeability pathways, particularly within the microbialite and spherulite facies of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
aggrading geometry,Sedimentary Structure,"The NLD defines the term as a 'stratigraphic stacking pattern' involving the 'vertical accretion of depositional units,' which fits the definition of a pattern of the internal arrangement of Depositional Units.","An aggrading geometry is a stratigraphic stacking pattern that is characterized by the vertical accretion of depositional units with minimal lateral displacement of facies. This geometry forms when sediment supply rates match accommodation creation rates, a critical process for developing the thick, vertically extensive microbialite and coquina reservoirs in the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
bioclastic grainstone,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'grain-supported carbonate rock that is composed of skeletal fragments', which are sedimentary particles.","A bioclastic grainstone is a grain-supported carbonate rock that is composed of skeletal fragments, primarily from bivalves and calcareous shrubs, and is devoid of a primary micritic matrix. This lithofacies is indicative of a high-energy depositional environment within the sag-phase lacustrine system of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its significant primary interparticle porosity, often enhanced by diagenesis, makes it a principal component of the most productive petroleum reservoirs in the province."
channel,Channel Unit,"The NLD describes an 'elongate, concave-up geobody... filled with... sediments,' which directly corresponds to the definition of a Channel Unit as an elongated Depositional Unit.","A channel is an elongate, concave-up geobody that is formed by erosional scour or localized non-deposition within a carbonate succession. It is characteristically filled with reworked, high-energy sediments, such as coquinas or spherulitic grainstones, which often constitute significant reservoir intervals in the Pre-Salt section."
diagenetic alteration,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'post-depositional process that modifies the mineralogy, fabric, and petrophysical properties of a sedimentary rock', which is a direct match for the definition of a Geological Process.","A diagenetic alteration is a post-depositional process that modifies the mineralogy, fabric, and petrophysical properties of a sedimentary rock, fundamentally controlling the quality of carbonate reservoirs in the Brazilian Pre-Salt. These modifications, primarily dissolution and cementation, are the principal controls on the creation, preservation, or destruction of the reservoir's porosity and permeability. The resulting rock fabric dictates the storage capacity and fluid-flow pathways within these complex geological systems."
evaporite sequence,Depositional Unit,"The NLD describes it as a 'thick and laterally extensive lithostratigraphic succession' composed of sedimentary rock, which fits the definition of a sedimentary geological object recognizable at a large mapping scale.","An evaporite sequence is a thick and laterally extensive lithostratigraphic succession that is predominantly composed of halite with associated anhydrite and other saline minerals. In the context of the Brazilian continental margin, this Aptian-age sequence constitutes the regional top seal for the underlying Pre-Salt petroleum system. Its rheological properties promote significant halokinesis, which profoundly influences the structural and stratigraphic framework of the overlying post-salt section."
extensional fault,Geological Structure,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'brittle deformation structure,' which directly aligns with the definition of the GeoCore category Geological Structure.","An extensional fault is a brittle deformation structure that accommodates crustal stretching, characterized by the downward displacement of the hanging wall relative to the footwall. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these faults formed the fundamental horst and graben architecture during the South Atlantic rifting phase. This inherited paleotopography was the primary control on the deposition of microbial carbonate reservoirs and the formation of structural traps."
gas,Earth Fluid,"The NLD describes the term as a 'fluid' and a 'phase of petroleum' in a 'gaseous state', which directly corresponds to the definition of Earth Fluid as a volume of fluid such as oil or gas.","Gas is a phase of petroleum that is composed predominantly of methane and other light hydrocarbons and exists in a gaseous state at reservoir conditions. Generated from the thermal cracking of lacustrine organic matter, this fluid often contains high concentrations of carbon dioxide and accumulates in carbonate reservoirs as a free gas cap or a non-associated accumulation."
lateral continuity,quality,"The NLD defines the term as a 'geological property' that describes the 'spatial extent' and 'predictable attributes' of a rock body, which aligns with the definition of a quality inhering in an independent continuant.","Lateral continuity is a geological property that describes the spatial extent over which a specific depositional facies or reservoir rock type, such as a Pre-Salt microbialite or coquina body, maintains predictable lithological and petrophysical attributes. This property is a critical parameter for assessing reservoir connectivity and estimating hydrocarbon volumes in place. The predictability of this extent is fundamentally controlled by the depositional environment and subsequent diagenetic overprint."
mg-clay,Earth Material,"The NLD defines mg-clay as a group of minerals that is a component of rock and forms via precipitation, fitting the definition of a natural amount of matter generated by a geological process.","An mg-clay is a group of authigenic magnesium-rich phyllosilicate minerals, primarily stevensite and kerolite, that forms via direct precipitation in the alkaline and silica-rich lacustrine environments of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. These clays are a key component of the source rock and non-reservoir intervals, significantly influencing diagenetic pathways and reservoir quality."
resistivity log,generically dependent continuant,"The NLD defines a log as a record of measurements, which is a form of information content or pattern that can be copied, fitting the definition of a generically dependent continuant.","A resistivity log is a geophysical well log that continuously records the electrical resistivity of formations penetrated by a borehole. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, its primary application is to differentiate between highly resistive hydrocarbon-bearing intervals and conductive saline water-saturated zones. This measurement is a fundamental input for calculating water saturation and identifying potential net pay."

This model visualizes acoustic impedance contrasts, which are interpreted to map the geological framework, delineate complex salt geometries, and characterize the internal architecture of carbonate reservoirs."
stratification,Sedimentary Structure,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'primary sedimentary structure' that consists of a pattern of internal arrangement (vertically stacked layers).,"Stratification is a primary sedimentary structure that consists of vertically stacked layers, or strata, resulting from temporal variations in depositional processes within a sedimentary basin. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine carbonates, these variations reflect changes in water chemistry, biological activity, and sediment supply that control the deposition of microbialites, coquinas, and siliciclastics. This layering is a fundamental control on the distribution of reservoir facies and the resulting petrophysical heterogeneity."
sylvite,Earth Material,"The NLD describes sylvite as a mineral that is a constituent of a salt succession, fitting the definition of a natural amount of solid matter generated by a geological process.",Sylvite is an evaporite mineral of potassium chloride (KCl) that is a key constituent of the Aptian salt succession in the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its distinct rheology and higher solubility compared to halite create zones of mechanical weakness that can compromise the integrity and sealing capacity of the regional evaporite layer. The presence and distribution of sylvite are therefore critical controls on both seal risk and drilling hazards.
syn-rift,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD defines the term as a 'phase' characterized by deposition occurring 'contemporaneous with' active crustal extension, which describes a period of time defined by geological processes.","Syn-rift is a tectono-stratigraphic phase that is characterized by deposition contemporaneous with the active crustal extension that formed the precursor basins of the South Atlantic. This phase is defined by active normal faulting, which created the half-graben architecture controlling the initial deposition of continental clastic and volcanic sequences. The resulting structural framework and elevated heat flow are fundamental to the subsequent development of the Pre-Salt petroleum system."

These deposits typically exhibit graded bedding and constitute important reservoir facies within the sag section of the Pre-Salt succession. They are characterized by high-energy depositional textures interbedded with fine-grained, organic-rich source rocks."
abiotic,quality,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'property' of a geological process or material, which directly corresponds to the BFO definition of a quality.","Abiotic is a property of a geological process or material that originates from purely physicochemical mechanisms, such as the direct precipitation of carbonates from supersaturated lacustrine waters, independent of mediation by living organisms."

These processes, strongly influenced by the depositional fluid chemistry, are fundamental in establishing the initial porosity and fabric of Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs. Key modifications include microbial cementation in microbialites, the dissolution of unstable aragonitic bioclasts in coquinas to create moldic porosity, and the precipitation of early cements."
effective porosity,quality,"The NLD defines the term as a 'petrophysical property that quantifies the fraction of the bulk rock volume', which directly aligns with the BFO definition of a quality that inheres in a material entity.","Effective porosity is a petrophysical property that quantifies the fraction of the bulk rock volume occupied by interconnected pore spaces available for fluid storage and transmission. It is distinguished from total porosity, which also includes isolated, non-communicating pores that do not contribute to fluid flow. In the complex carbonate facies of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this property is the critical parameter for defining net reservoir, as it directly controls permeability and the volume of recoverable hydrocarbons."
lake level fluctuation,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'process' that is driven by climate and tectonism and governs the stratigraphic architecture and diagenetic evolution of sedimentary successions.,"A lake level fluctuation is a variation in the elevation of a lacustrine water surface that is driven by the interplay between climate and tectonism.

This condition promotes the accumulation and preservation of fine-grained sediments, such as laminated carbonate mudstones and organic-rich facies. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, these deposits typically constitute critical source rocks and sealing intervals."
micropore,site,"The NLD defines a micropore as a 'pore space' or 'void' within a rock, which corresponds to the BFO definition of a site as a three-dimensional immaterial entity whose boundaries are determined by a material entity.","A micropore is a pore space within a carbonate rock that is generally too small to be resolved by standard petrographic microscopy. In Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, these pores are predominantly intraparticle voids within spherulites and bioclasts or intercrystalline voids within the fine-grained matrix. They constitute a significant volume for hydrocarbon storage but typically exhibit low permeability and high irreducible water saturation due to strong capillary forces."
mineral,Earth Material,"The NLD describes a mineral as a naturally occurring, crystalline solid that is the fundamental constituent of rocks, which aligns with the definition of Earth Material as a natural amount of matter.","A mineral is a naturally occurring, crystalline solid that is the fundamental constituent of rocks, such as the carbonate reservoirs and evaporitic seals of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. It is defined by a specific chemical composition and an ordered atomic structure. The mineral assemblage and its diagenetic alterations directly govern the petrophysical properties that define reservoir quality."

It precipitates directly from alkaline, silica-rich lake waters, forming grain coatings and pore-filling cements that exert a fundamental control on reservoir quality. The diagenetic transformation of saponite is a critical process governing the evolution of the reservoir's porosity and permeability."
seismic stratigraphy,process,"The NLD describes seismic stratigraphy as a 'method' involving actions like 'analyzes' and 'infer,' which are activities that unfold over time, consistent with the definition of a process.","Seismic stratigraphy is a geophysical method that analyzes seismic reflection geometries and terminations to define depositional sequences and infer the geological history of sedimentary basins. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is crucial for delineating the architecture of Aptian lacustrine carbonate systems, such as microbialite and coquina reservoirs. The method aids in predicting reservoir presence and quality by correlating seismic facies patterns with depositional environments within the sag phase of the rift basin."

In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt's stratified lacustrine system, this high-energy setting controlled the development and reworking of microbial and bioclastic carbonates. These deposits, particularly coquinas and grain-dominated microbialites, constitute the primary high-quality petroleum reservoirs."
weathering,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines weathering as a 'set of exogenic geological processes' that cause physical and chemical changes to rocks.,"Weathering is a set of exogenic geological processes that causes the in-situ physical disintegration and chemical decomposition of rocks at or near the Earth's surface. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this alteration of the crystalline basement is a fundamental mechanism for creating secondary porosity in potential reservoirs. It is also the primary driver of karstification in the carbonate successions during periods of subaerial exposure, which significantly enhances reservoir heterogeneity and quality."
deep lake,site,"The NLD defines a 'depositional environment' within a 'basin', which is a three-dimensional space whose boundaries are determined by surrounding material entities, consistent with the definition of a site.","A deep lake is a large-scale lacustrine depositional environment that formed within a continental rift basin, characterized by a deep, chemically stratified water column. This stratification promotes anoxic bottom waters for the preservation of organic-rich source rocks and alkaline surface waters for the precipitation of microbial and abiotic carbonate reservoirs. These conditions are the primary control on the development of the prolific petroleum systems of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."

The paleotopography of this basement rock significantly controlled the depositional architecture and distribution of the overlying sag-phase carbonate reservoirs.
hinge line,Geological Structure,"The term is classified as a Geological Structure because the NLD describes it as a 'zone of crustal flexure' that 'controls the architecture of the basin,' fitting the definition of a feature that describes the arrangement of geological objects.","A hinge line is a regional, linear zone of crustal flexure that separates a relatively stable platform from an adjacent, actively subsiding basin. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this zone is associated with the main rift-bounding fault systems that created the accommodation space for syn-rift deposition. It fundamentally controls the architecture of the basin and the distribution of lacustrine source rocks and carbonate reservoir facies."
laminated carbonate,Sedimentary Rock,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'microbial carbonate rock' characterized by specific laminae and microfabric.,"A laminated carbonate is a microbial carbonate rock that is characterized by millimeter-scale laminae resulting from the cyclic growth of microbial mats and abiotic mineral precipitation within a lacustrine depositional system. This facies constitutes a primary reservoir target in the Brazilian Pre-Salt, where its unique spherulitic and shrub-like microfabric can host significant primary porosity."
mechanical subsidence,Geological Process,The NLD defines the term as a 'downward vertical movement of the Earth's crust' and explicitly calls it a 'process' that modifies geological objects by creating accommodation space.,"Mechanical subsidence is a downward vertical movement of the Earth's crust that is driven by lithospheric stretching, normal faulting, and the isostatic response to sediment and volcanic loading. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process dominated the rift phase, creating the accommodation space necessary for the deposition of lacustrine source rocks and carbonate reservoirs within graben and half-graben structures. This rapid, fault-controlled sinking is distinct from the slower, regional thermal subsidence that characterized the subsequent post-rift sag phase."
precambrian,Geological Object,"The NLD defines the term as a 'geologic unit' and 'crystalline economic basement', which fits the definition of a rigid entity with its own identity and unity criteria.",Precambrian is a geologic unit of predominantly igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks that constitutes the crystalline economic basement underlying the Phanerozoic successions of the Brazilian Pre-Salt basins.

This sequence contains the primary lacustrine source rocks and prolific microbial-coquinoid carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system."
rift system,Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as a 'tectonic province' with a distinct architecture, which is a large-scale, rigid entity generated by a geological process (crustal extension).","A rift system is a tectonic province that is dominated by crustal extension, creating a distinct structural architecture of horsts and grabens. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this framework governed the entire petroleum system by forming deep lacustrine depocenters for prolific source rocks and adjacent structural highs that localized the development of microbial carbonate reservoirs. The resulting rift-phase topography provides the large structural closures that form the primary trapping mechanism for these accumulations."
rift margin,Geological Boundary,"The NLD explicitly defines a rift margin as a 'major tectonic boundary' that separates two distinct geological zones, which directly corresponds to the definition of a Geological Boundary.","A rift margin is a major tectonic boundary that separates a zone of continental extension from an adjacent, stable craton. It is characterized by a system of large-displacement normal faults that define the transition from thinned crust within the rift basin to the thicker, less-extended continental crust. In the South Atlantic, this margin's architecture controlled the initial deposition and geometry of the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine source rocks and reservoirs."

In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these features, including horsts, grabens, and faulted anticlines, create the primary traps for hydrocarbon accumulation. They also govern reservoir distribution and compartmentalization, directly impacting exploration risk and field development."
structure map,generically dependent continuant,"The NLD defines a structure map as a representation of geological geometry, which aligns with the BFO definition of a generically dependent continuant as a pattern or content that can be copied, like a blueprint or a file.","A structure map is a subsurface geological map that represents the three-dimensional geometry of a specific surface, such as a key seismic reflector, using contour lines of equal depth relative to a datum. It is a fundamental product of seismic interpretation used to identify and delineate structural closures that may act as hydrocarbon traps. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these maps are critical for defining the structural framework of the carbonate reservoirs and quantifying the closure of microbial buildups beneath the salt canopy."
tholeiitic basalt,Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'volcanic rock', which is a type of solid, consolidated Earth Material as per the GeoCore definition.","A tholeiitic basalt is a subalkaline mafic volcanic rock that is defined by an iron-enrichment trend during fractional crystallization. In the context of the Brazilian continental margin, it constitutes the continental flood basalts of the Paraná-Etendeka Large Igneous Province, which formed during the Early Cretaceous opening of the South Atlantic. These volcanic successions typically form the acoustic basement for the overlying Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs."

carbonate mud,Sediment,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'fine-grained carbonate sediment' composed of unconsolidated clay-sized particles.,"Carbonate mud is a fine-grained carbonate sediment that consists of clay-sized particles of calcite or aragonite, often precipitated microbially or chemically in low-energy lacustrine depositional systems. Upon lithification, it forms micrite, which constitutes the matrix of mud-supported reservoir facies such as wackestones and floatstones. When enriched with organic matter, this lithology can also function as a primary source rock within the Pre-Salt petroleum system."
carbonate system,Depositional System,"The NLD defines the term as an 'integrated depositional... system' that governs the spatial distribution of carbonate rocks, which aligns with the definition of an object aggregate of linked depositional units.","A carbonate system is an integrated depositional and diagenetic system that governs the formation, spatial distribution, and subsequent alteration of carbonate rocks. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this system is uniquely characterized by its development in a lacustrine rift setting, dominated by microbial and bioclastic carbonate production. The system's complex evolution through multi-phase diagenesis is the primary control on the reservoir's architecture and its final petrophysical properties."

This area, often referred to as the petroleum kitchen, is a critical element for quantifying the total volume of hydrocarbons available to charge a trap. The geometry and effectiveness of the fetch are controlled by the depositional extent of the source facies, its thermal history, and the presence of migration pathways."

mg-silicate clay,Sediment,"The NLD describes it as a group of authigenic clay minerals that precipitate and form a depositional matrix, which fits the definition of an unconsolidated earth material constituted by a collection of sedimentary particles.","An mg-silicate clay is a group of authigenic clay minerals, including stevensite and kerolite, that precipitates directly from the magnesium- and silica-rich alkaline lacustrine waters of the Aptian sag basin. These minerals form the depositional matrix of key reservoir facies, such as microbialites and coquinas. Their distribution and diagenetic alteration are a primary control on reservoir quality."
palaeotopography,quality,"The NLD defines it as the 'geomorphological configuration' or 'relief' of a buried surface, which is a shape-like property that inheres in that surface.","Palaeotopography is the geomorphological configuration of a buried surface that represents the relief of the land or seafloor at a specific time in the geological past. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is the inherited top-basement relief, formed during the rift phase, that fundamentally controlled the architecture of the overlying sag basin. This control dictated the deposition of lacustrine source rocks within palaeolows and the nucleation of microbial carbonate reservoirs upon palaeohighs."
seismic trace,generically dependent continuant,"The NLD defines a seismic trace as a 'time-series record' representing a physical response, which is an informational pattern that can be copied, fitting the definition of a generically dependent continuant.","A seismic trace is a time-series record that represents the Earth's acoustic reflectivity response to propagated seismic energy at a specific surface coordinate. As the fundamental building block of a seismic volume, its amplitude and phase variations correspond to subsurface acoustic impedance contrasts. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these contrasts are interpreted to delineate complex salt bodies and characterize the internal heterogeneity of the carbonate reservoirs."
stratigraphic chart,generically dependent continuant,"The NLD defines the term as a 'graphical representation', which is an information content entity or pattern that can be copied, fitting the definition of a generically dependent continuant.","A stratigraphic chart is a graphical representation that illustrates the vertical sequence, age, and stratigraphic relationships of rock units within a sedimentary basin. It provides the essential framework for contextualizing the temporal and spatial distribution of petroleum system elements, such as the Pre-Salt's Barremian source rocks, Aptian carbonate reservoirs, and the overlying evaporitic seal. This framework is critical for defining exploration plays and understanding the basin's tectono-stratigraphic evolution."
base of salt,Geological Boundary,"The NLD defines the term as a 'major stratigraphic surface' and a 'lower boundary' separating two geological sections, which fits the definition of a Geological Boundary.","The base of salt is a major stratigraphic surface that defines the lower boundary of the Aptian evaporite succession.

It is a critical seismic marker for mapping petroleum traps and understanding the geometry of the pre-salt sag basin."
carbonate build-up,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines it as a 'localized carbonate sedimentary body' with 'positive topographic relief', which is consistent with a recognizable depositional feature.","A carbonate build-up is a localized carbonate sedimentary body that is constructed by the in-situ accumulation of microbial organisms and/or abiotic precipitates, resulting in a feature with positive topographic relief relative to surrounding deposits. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these features are predominantly lacustrine microbialites and spherulites that developed during the sag phase of the South Atlantic rift system. They constitute the primary high-quality reservoir targets due to their significant volume and favorable petrophysical properties."
in situ facies,Sedimentary Facies,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'facies' characterized by its primary components and their preservation, which are sedimentological characteristics of depositional units.","An in situ facies is a facies that is defined by its primary components being formed and preserved in their original site of growth or precipitation. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this typically includes microbialites, such as stromatolites and thrombolites, or autochthonous coquinas where organisms have undergone negligible transport after death. These facies are critical indicators of the depositional environment's energy and accommodation space, directly influencing reservoir quality."
sequence stratigraphy,generically dependent continuant,"The NLD defines this term as a 'geological framework that analyzes sedimentary deposits,' which is a conceptual pattern or content that can be shared and copied, fitting the definition of a generically dependent continuant.","Sequence stratigraphy is a geological framework that analyzes sedimentary deposits as a succession of genetically related packages, called depositional sequences, bounded by unconformities and their correlative conformities. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this framework is fundamental for predicting the architecture and distribution of lacustrine carbonate reservoirs and associated seals. The development of these sequences is primarily controlled by the interplay between accommodation space, driven by tectonic subsidence, and sediment supply, modulated by climatically-induced lake-level fluctuations."

These grains are a primary constituent of the microbialitic and grainy carbonate reservoir facies of the Barra Velha Formation."
topography,Geometry,"The NLD defines topography as the 'three-dimensional configuration of a surface' and 'morphology', which directly aligns with the definition of Geometry as a quality related to external three-dimensional shape.","Topography is the three-dimensional configuration of a surface that, in the Brazilian Pre-Salt, primarily describes the paleorelief of key geological interfaces such as the pre-rift basement or the top of carbonate reservoirs. This inherited paleotopography is a fundamental control on the distribution of accommodation space, depositional facies, and reservoir quality within the sag phase lacustrine succession. The morphology of the carbonate buildups themselves also represents a critical depositional topography that governs reservoir heterogeneity."
base salt,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines the term as a 'stratigraphic unit' and a 'depositional phase' representing a halite-dominated evaporite succession, which aligns with the definition of a Depositional Unit.","Base salt is a halite-dominated evaporite succession that forms the lowermost stratigraphic unit of the Aptian salt package, directly overlying the pre-salt carbonate reservoirs in Brazil's Santos and Campos basins. This unit represents the initial depositional phase of the regional evaporitic seal, marking the termination of the underlying sag-phase carbonate system. Its distinct seismic character and contact with the reservoir are critical for defining the top of the pre-salt exploration target and assessing seal integrity."
basement high,Geological Object,"The NLD describes it as a physical feature ('paleotopographic culmination') composed of a specific material ('crystalline rock'), which aligns with the definition of a Geological Object as a rigid entity generated by geological processes.","A basement high is a positive structural feature composed of crystalline rock that formed a paleotopographic culmination during the syn-rift to sag transition. This paleotopography governed the nucleation and subsequent aggradation of the overlying lacustrine carbonate reservoirs. Ultimately, these highs form the core of the large structural closures that constitute the primary traps in the Pre-Salt petroleum system."
climate change,Geological Process,"The NLD describes it as a 'long-term variation' and a 'process' that modifies the composition and arrangement of geological objects, namely the carbonate facies and reservoirs.","Climate change is a long-term variation in regional and global atmospheric conditions that, during the Aptian, directly controlled the depositional evolution of the South Atlantic sag basins. These variations drove cyclical shifts between arid and humid periods, fundamentally altering the hydrochemistry and water levels of the Pre-Salt lacustrine systems. This process governed the precipitation of specific microbial and abiotic carbonate facies, thereby determining the architecture and quality of the Pre-Salt reservoirs."
salt basin,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The definition describes it as a 'sedimentary basin' containing an 'evaporite sequence', which fits the definition of a geological object constituted by sedimentary rock.","A salt basin is a sedimentary basin that contains a thick, laterally extensive evaporite sequence deposited during a period of restricted marine circulation. This evaporitic succession acts as a regional seal for underlying petroleum systems, such as the Brazilian Pre-Salt. The high thermal conductivity and mobility of the salt profoundly influence the basin's thermal history and structural evolution."

It is a critical input for seismic migration and time-to-depth conversion, enabling the accurate structural and stratigraphic imaging of sub-salt carbonate reservoirs. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this model must precisely characterize the complex geometry and internal velocity variations of the Aptian salt layer to correctly position the underlying microbialite and coquina reservoir targets."
barite,Earth Material,"The NLD describes barite as a 'diagenetic sulfate mineral' that acts as a 'cement,' which fits the definition of an amount of solid matter generated by a geological process, lacking its own unity criteria when acting as a pervasive cement.","Barite is a diagenetic sulfate mineral that acts as a pervasive, pore-occluding cement in Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs. Its precipitation from hydrothermal or mixed formation fluids severely reduces primary and secondary porosity, critically degrading reservoir quality in key facies such as coquinas and microbialites. The presence of barite is often associated with fluid flow along major fault and fracture systems."
depositional sequence,Depositional System,"The NLD defines it as a 'genetically related succession of strata,' which fits the definition of a Depositional System as an aggregate of linked depositional units.","A depositional sequence is a fundamental stratigraphic unit that is composed of a relatively conformable, genetically related succession of strata bounded by unconformities and their correlative conformities. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine setting, these sequences record a full cycle of lake-level change driven by the interplay of tectonics, climate, and sediment input. Its internal stacking patterns and bounding surfaces govern the distribution, connectivity, and quality of microbial and coquina carbonate reservoirs."

Its originally aragonitic shell is highly susceptible to dissolution, making it a principal contributor to the development of high-quality moldic and vuggy porosity. Consequently, gastropod-rich facies, such as coquinas and grainstones, often form the most productive reservoir intervals."
host rock,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as a 'rock body' composed of sedimentary materials ('lacustrine microbialites and coquinas'), which fits the definition of a geological object constituted by sedimentary rock.","A host rock is a rock body that encloses and contains a petroleum accumulation within its porous and permeable framework.

intraclast rudstone,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'grain-supported carbonate rock' whose framework is composed of clasts, which fits the definition of a rock constituted by a collection of sedimentary grains.","An intraclast rudstone is a grain-supported carbonate rock whose framework is composed of clasts larger than 2 mm that are derived from the erosion and redeposition of penecontemporaneous lacustrine sediments. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these high-energy deposits are commonly composed of reworked fragments of coquinas, spherulites, or microbialites. This depositional process often creates a rock fabric with significant primary interparticle porosity, forming excellent reservoir intervals."
intracrystalline porosity,site,"The NLD defines the term as 'voids confined within the boundaries of individual crystals', which corresponds to the BFO definition of a site as a 3D immaterial entity whose boundaries are determined by a material entity.","Intracrystalline porosity is a type of secondary porosity that consists of voids confined within the boundaries of individual crystals, typically formed by the selective dissolution of the crystal's interior. This diagenetic feature is a significant contributor to the total storage volume in the complex calcite and dolomite fabrics of Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs. Its impact on permeability, however, is highly dependent on its connection to the intercrystalline pore network."
metamorphic rock,Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'rock', which is a solid consolidated Earth Material, directly matching the GeoCore category.","A metamorphic rock is a rock formed through the solid-state alteration of a pre-existing protolith by heat and pressure that, in the Brazilian Pre-Salt, constitutes the crystalline economic basement. This basement's paleotopography exerted a primary control on the deposition of the overlying syn-rift lacustrine source rocks and carbonate reservoirs. Its high thermal conductivity is also a key factor governing the geothermal gradient responsible for hydrocarbon maturation."
microporosity,Geological Structure,"The NLD defines microporosity as a 'pore system' composed of 'voids located within the internal fabric' of rock, which aligns with the definition of a Geological Structure as the internal arrangement of a Geological Object.","Microporosity is a pore system that is composed of sub-micron to micron-scale voids located within the internal fabric of the spherulites and fascicular calcite crystals characteristic of Pre-Salt carbonates. This system contributes substantially to the total hydrocarbon storage capacity of the reservoir. However, due to poor pore connectivity at this scale, it provides negligible effective permeability, creating a dual-porosity system where fluid flow is dominated by the macropore network."
pore type,Facies,"The NLD defines a 'pore type' as a class of void space based on its geometry and relationship to rock fabric, which aligns with the definition of a Facies as a pattern of properties of a Geological Object.","A pore type is a class of void space within a rock that is defined by its genesis, geometry, and relationship to the rock's fabric elements. In carbonate systems like the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this classification distinguishes fabric-selective pores (e.g., moldic, interparticle) from non-fabric-selective pores (e.g., vugs, fractures) that together control reservoir storage and flow properties."
saddle dolomite,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD defines it as a 'diagenetic variety of dolomite,' which is a type of rock constituted by crystalline mineral matter formed through alteration of precursor materials.","Saddle dolomite is a high-temperature diagenetic variety of dolomite that is characterized by large, coarsely crystalline crystals with curved faces and undulatory extinction. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it precipitates from hydrothermal fluids migrating along fault and fracture systems, often as an alteration product of precursor magnesian clays. Its occurrence is a critical indicator of post-depositional thermal alteration, which significantly impacts reservoir quality by occluding matrix porosity while being associated with permeable fracture corridors."
carbonate precipitate,Earth Material,"The NLD describes it as a 'crystalline solid' that constitutes rocks, fitting the definition of Earth Material as a natural amount of solid matter generated by a geological process.","A carbonate precipitate is a crystalline solid that is formed by the direct crystallization of carbonate minerals from a supersaturated aqueous solution.

This measurement is a primary input for calculating formation porosity, a critical parameter for characterizing the complex pore systems of carbonate reservoirs. In combination with other logs, it also aids in identifying lithology and the presence of gas."
static model,generically dependent continuant,"The NLD defines a static model as a 'numerical representation,' which is an informational pattern that can be copied, fitting the definition of a generically dependent continuant.","A static model is a three-dimensional numerical representation of a reservoir that integrates seismic, well, and core data to define the geological framework and the spatial distribution of petrophysical properties prior to production. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, its primary function is to characterize the complex heterogeneity of carbonate facies to provide a robust basis for in-place volume calculation and dynamic simulation. This model serves as the foundational geological input for assessing resources and planning field development."
lake hydrology,Geological Process,The NLD defines the term as a 'system of physical and chemical processes' that governs deposition and geochemistry within a geological system.,"Lake hydrology is a system of physical and chemical processes that governs the water balance, stratification, and geochemistry within ancient lacustrine depositional systems.

This substance is capable of flow through the porous medium when a pressure differential is applied."
laminated calcimudstone,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'fine-grained carbonate rock' constituted by carbonate mud and organic matter, which are sedimentary particles.","A laminated calcimudstone is a fine-grained carbonate rock that is defined by rhythmically alternating, sub-millimeter to centimeter-scale laminae of organic matter and carbonate mud. These deposits are characteristic of the anoxic bottom waters of the Pre-Salt lacustrine system, where they function as the primary hydrocarbon source rock."
sedimentary succession,Depositional System,"The NLD describes a 'vertical sequence of genetically related strata' and an 'ordered accumulation of sediments', which aligns with a Depositional System being an aggregate of linked depositional units.","A sedimentary succession is a vertical sequence of genetically related strata that records the tectono-stratigraphic evolution of a sedimentary basin. This ordered accumulation of sediments, bounded by unconformities, reflects changing depositional environments and contains the key elements of a petroleum system. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this encompasses the syn-rift clastics, the sag-phase lacustrine source and carbonate reservoir rocks, and the overlying evaporitic seal."
abiotic process,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geological process that modifies the composition, texture, or fabric of rocks', which directly matches the definition of the GeoCore category.","An abiotic process is a geological process that modifies the composition, texture, or fabric of rocks without direct mediation by living organisms. These processes are critical in controlling the diagenetic evolution and reservoir quality of Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, encompassing phenomena such as hydrothermal fluid circulation, evaporite precipitation, and burial-related cementation. Such modifications fundamentally alter the primary depositional framework, creating or destroying porosity and permeability."
breakup,Geological Process,"The NLD defines the term as a 'tectono-magmatic event' involving processes like continental rifting and seafloor spreading, which generate and modify geological objects.","Breakup is a tectono-magmatic event that marks the final cessation of continental rifting and the initiation of seafloor spreading between continental plates. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this event is represented by the Aptian unconformity that separates the syn-rift and sag depositional sequences from the subsequent post-rift drift phase. This transition is often accompanied by extensive volcanism, forming Seaward Dipping Reflectors."
carbonate production,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'set of biogeochemical processes that generates carbonate sediment', which directly matches the definition of a Geological Process.","Carbonate production is the set of biogeochemical processes that generates carbonate sediment *in situ* from dissolved ions in the water column. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this is driven primarily by microbial activity and direct chemical precipitation within extensive, alkaline lacustrine environments. These processes form the precursors to key reservoir facies such as microbialites and spherulitic limestones."
clast,Geological Object,"The NLD describes a clast as a discrete sedimentary particle or fragment derived from pre-existing rock, which fits the definition of a Geological Object as a rigid entity with its own identity and unity criteria.","A clast is a sedimentary particle that is derived from the physical breakdown of pre-existing, typically intrabasinal, carbonate rocks such as microbialites or coquinas. These fragments are transported and redeposited by high-energy events, forming constituent grains within reservoir facies like rudstones and grainstones."
continental siliciclastic,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines the term as a 'sedimentary deposit' composed of silicate mineral fragments, which directly aligns with the definition of a geological object constituted by sediment or sedimentary rock.","A continental siliciclastic deposit is a sedimentary deposit that is composed predominantly of silicate mineral fragments and was deposited in non-marine terrestrial environments. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these deposits constitute the syn-rift succession, encompassing fluvial, lacustrine, and eolian systems that filled the initial rift basins. These successions can function as source rocks, reservoirs, or seals, typically underlying the main sag-phase carbonate reservoirs."
cross-lamination,Sedimentary Structure,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'primary sedimentary structure' consisting of an internal arrangement of laminae.,"Cross-lamination is a primary sedimentary structure that is composed of sets of laminae inclined at an angle to the principal bedding surface. This structure forms from the migration of bedforms under tractive currents, recording the transport of granular sediment such as the bioclasts and ooids that constitute high-energy Pre-Salt carbonate facies. Its presence is a key indicator of depositional energy and is often associated with the development of well-sorted intervals with superior reservoir quality."
debris apron,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines the term as a 'wedge-shaped sedimentary body' composed of clasts, which fits the definition of a Depositional Unit as a recognizable sedimentary geological object.","A debris apron is a wedge-shaped sedimentary body that is composed predominantly of coarse-grained, gravity-reworked carbonate clasts deposited at the base of a carbonate buildup or platform margin. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these deposits are typically sourced from the erosion of adjacent microbialitic and coquina facies during periods of relative sea-level fall or tectonic instability. They constitute significant clastic reservoir targets characterized by high interparticle porosity and permeability."
depositional condition,quality,"The NLD defines this term as a set of physical, chemical, and biological parameters, such as water chemistry and hydrodynamic energy, which are qualities that inhere in a depositional environment.","A depositional condition is a set of physical, chemical, and biological parameters that governs the processes of sediment accumulation and early modification within a specific depositional environment. These parameters, such as the specific water chemistry of the sag-phase lacustrine system, hydrodynamic energy, and microbial activity, directly control the resulting carbonate facies architecture and its initial reservoir quality. The interpretation of these conditions is fundamental to predicting the distribution of microbialites and coquinas in the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
evaporitic lake,Depositional System,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'depositional system', which is a direct match to the GeoReservoir category.","An evaporitic lake is a vast, restricted depositional system that occupied the South Atlantic rift basins during the Aptian sag phase. This system was defined by a hypersaline water body where extreme evaporation precipitated the thick salt succession that forms the regional seal for the Pre-Salt petroleum system."
fault block high,Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as a physical, bounded entity ('composed of...strata...bounded by...faults') generated by a geological process (rifting), which matches the definition of a Geological Object.","A fault block high is a structural high, composed of uplifted basement or pre-rift strata, that is bounded by normal faults generated during continental rifting. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this elevated paleo-topography creates a focal point for the deposition of high-energy microbialite and coquina carbonate reservoirs. It simultaneously forms the core of a major structural trap for hydrocarbons generated in the adjacent syn-rift source kitchens."
groundwater,Earth Fluid,"The NLD defines groundwater as a 'subsurface aqueous fluid' and 'formation water,' which directly aligns with the definition of Earth Fluid as a natural volume of fluid material.","Groundwater is the subsurface aqueous fluid that saturates the pore system of a geological formation. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, it is the formation water, typically a hypersaline brine, that coexists with hydrocarbons and critically influences diagenetic pathways in the carbonate reservoirs. This water's complex composition reflects a mixture of meteoric, connate, and hydrothermal sources related to the basin's tectono-stratigraphic evolution."
growth phase,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD defines the term as a 'tectonic stage' and a 'phase' characterized by specific geological processes, which corresponds to a temporal region occupied by those processes.","A growth phase is a tectonic stage within the post-rift succession that is characterized by the active, gravity-driven movement of Aptian salt structures. This halokinesis deforms the overlying strata, creating accommodation space and forming structural closures. The timing and intensity of this phase are critical controls on the development of post-salt traps and reservoirs."
half-graben system,Geological Structure,"The NLD defines the term as a 'structural framework' resulting from rifting, which aligns with the definition of a Geological Structure as the configuration and mutual relationships of different parts of a Geological Object.","A half-graben system is a structural framework of asymmetric depocenters that develops during continental rifting, where each depocenter is controlled by a master normal fault and an opposing hinged margin. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this framework creates the deep lacustrine settings for source rock deposition within the graben axis. It also forms the adjacent structural highs that are the preferential sites for the development of microbial carbonate reservoirs."
lake water chemistry,quality,"The NLD defines the term as a 'set of geochemical properties' like salinity and alkalinity, which are qualities that inhere in the lacustrine water body.","Lake water chemistry is the set of geochemical properties of a lacustrine water body that, within the Brazilian Pre-Salt sag basins, fundamentally controlled the precipitation of non-skeletal carbonates and their subsequent diagenesis. Key parameters, including salinity, alkalinity, and the Mg/Ca ratio, dictated the formation of unique reservoir facies such as spherulites and microbialites. This chemical control is therefore a primary determinant of the distribution and quality of the petroleum reservoir."
late jurassic,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geologic epoch', which is a specific interval of geological time during which geological processes, such as deposition, occurred.","The Late Jurassic is a geologic epoch that concludes the Jurassic Period and represents the pre-rift, continental phase prior to the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this epoch is characterized by the deposition of widespread desert systems, including eolian and fluvial sandstones. These successions form the economic basement to the main Pre-Salt petroleum system, underlying the lacustrine source rocks and carbonate reservoirs."
marine incursion,Geological Process,"The NLD defines the term as a 'geological event' that involves actions like flooding, altering, terminating, and initiating, which fits the definition of a process that modifies geological objects and systems.","A marine incursion is a transgressive geological event that floods a previously non-marine or restricted basin with oceanic water, fundamentally altering its hydrochemistry and depositional systems. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this event marks the pivotal transition from the Barremian lacustrine sag phase to the Aptian saline giant environment. This shift terminated the deposition of key lacustrine source rocks and initiated the precipitation of the regional salt seal, which is critical to the petroleum system."
mechanical compaction,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'physical diagenetic process' that modifies sediments, which directly aligns with the definition of a Geological Process.","Mechanical compaction is a physical diagenetic process that reduces the bulk volume and porosity of sediments under increasing effective stress from overburden. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, this process is manifested by the rearrangement and fracturing of bioclasts in coquinas or the crushing of delicate fabrics in microbialites. This porosity loss occurs primarily through physical mechanisms, distinguishing it from chemical compaction processes such as pressure solution."
microfacies,Sedimentary Facies,"The NLD defines a microfacies as a 'distinct assemblage of petrographic characteristics' observed in a rock, which directly corresponds to the definition of a Sedimentary Facies as the sum of sedimentological characteristics.","A microfacies is a distinct assemblage of petrographic characteristics, including constituent grains, matrix, cement, and fabric, that is observed in thin section and reflects a specific depositional environment and its subsequent diagenetic history. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, microfacies analysis is fundamental for characterizing the complex interplay between depositional textures, such as microbial frameworks and coquinas, and the diagenetic processes that ultimately control reservoir quality. This characterization allows for the definition of rock types used in geological modeling."
nodule,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines a nodule as a 'discrete diagenetic body' and a 'mass' embedded within a host carbonate rock, which aligns with the definition of a geological object constituted by sedimentary material.","A nodule is a discrete diagenetic body that forms as a subspherical to irregular mass of contrasting mineral composition, most commonly chert or anhydrite, embedded within the host Pre-Salt carbonate rock. This feature originates from post-depositional processes, such as replacement or precipitation, and often reduces local reservoir quality by occluding primary porosity."
organic acid,Earth Fluid,"The NLD describes it as a 'component of pore fluids' that acts as a diagenetic agent, which fits the definition of a natural fluid matter found within the Earth.","An organic acid is a diagenetic agent that is derived from the thermal maturation of lacustrine kerogen within the Pre-Salt source rocks. It is a key component of pore fluids responsible for the dissolution of carbonate minerals, such as calcite and dolomite. This process is critical for creating and enhancing secondary porosity in microbialite and coquina reservoirs."
planar lamination,Sedimentary Structure,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'primary sedimentary structure' and describes its internal arrangement of parallel laminae.,"Planar lamination is a primary sedimentary structure that is composed of parallel, sub-horizontal laminae, each typically less than one centimeter thick. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine systems, it commonly forms from the settling of fine-grained carbonate from suspension in anoxic bottom waters or through the tractional alignment of platy bioclasts. This structure is a key indicator of low-energy depositional environments and can be associated with intervals of high source rock potential."
pre-rift,Depositional System,"The NLD defines the term as a 'tectono-stratigraphic megasequence' and a 'package of sedimentary and volcanic rocks,' which aligns with the definition of an aggregate of linked depositional units.","Pre-rift is a tectono-stratigraphic megasequence that comprises the package of sedimentary and volcanic rocks deposited on the Gondwanan basement prior to the main extensional faulting phase associated with the South Atlantic opening. This succession is typically composed of Paleozoic siliciclastic deposits and Mesozoic desertic sequences, including extensive flood basalts of the Paraná-Etendeka province. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this unit constitutes the economic basement upon which the syn-rift source rocks and subsequent carbonate reservoirs were deposited."
pre-salt structure,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD describes a 'structural high' formed within a 'sedimentary succession' that hosts reservoirs, which aligns with the definition of a geological object constituted by sedimentary rock.","A pre-salt structure is a structural high that formed within the syn-rift to sag sedimentary succession of the South Atlantic passive margin. This feature is stratigraphically positioned beneath the regional Aptian evaporite sequence, which provides the essential top seal for hydrocarbon accumulations. Commonly manifested as horsts or tilted fault blocks, these structures host the prolific carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system."
redeposited,quality,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as an 'attribute' of a deposit, which is a characteristic that inheres in an object, matching the BFO definition of a quality.","Redeposited is an attribute of a carbonate deposit whose constituent clasts, such as microbialite spherulites or coquina fragments, have been eroded from a high-energy setting and transported by gravity flows to accumulate as a distinct facies in a lower-energy part of the basin. These grain-supported deposits, often forming grainstones and rudstones, constitute the most significant reservoir intervals in the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
sag basin,Depositional System,"The NLD describes a sag basin as a broad unit containing an accumulation of multiple successions (carbonate and clastic), which fits the definition of an aggregate of mereotopologically linked depositional units.","A sag basin is a broad tectonic-stratigraphic unit that develops during the post-rift stage of basin evolution, characterized by regional, long-wavelength subsidence driven primarily by thermal cooling and contraction of the lithosphere. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this phase initiates with the deposition of the Aptian salt, which acts as a regional seal, and continues with the accumulation of the thick post-salt carbonate and clastic successions. The substantial sedimentary load of the sag sequence is a critical factor for driving the maturation of the underlying lacustrine source rocks and for triggering the halokinesis that creates structural traps for the microbialite reservoirs."
sidewall sample,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD defines the term as a 'discrete rock sample' and provides an example of its use in characterizing carbonate reservoirs, which are composed of sedimentary rock.","A sidewall sample is a discrete rock sample that is mechanically extracted from the wall of a borehole using a wireline-conveyed tool. It provides crucial ground-truth data at specific depths, selected based on well log responses, for direct petrophysical and geological analysis. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these samples are vital for characterizing the complex textures of carbonate reservoirs and calibrating formation evaluation models used to estimate porosity and permeability."
subsurface,site,"The NLD defines the term as a three-dimensional volume of the Earth's crust whose boundaries are determined relative to a material entity (the seafloor), which perfectly matches the definition of a site.","The subsurface is a volume of the Earth's crust that extends downwards from a reference surface, such as the seafloor, and contains all geological materials, fluids, and structures. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this volume is the domain of petroleum systems investigation, encompassing the post-salt, salt, and pre-salt megasequences. It is characterized and modeled using geophysical data, well logs, and rock samples."
sweeping extinction,Facies,"The NLD defines the term as an 'optical phenomenon' and a 'diagenetic feature' observed in minerals, which aligns with the definition of Facies as a visual pattern of properties of Geological Objects.","Sweeping extinction is an optical phenomenon in anisotropic minerals that is characterized by a wave of darkness moving across a crystal during stage rotation under cross-polarized light. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is a key diagenetic feature in calcite spherulites and cements, indicating plastic deformation of the crystal lattice. This deformation is typically induced by stresses related to burial compaction or salt tectonics, impacting reservoir rock properties."
volcanic clast,Geological Object,"The NLD defines a volcanic clast as a 'lithoclast' (a fragment of rock), which is a rigid entity with its own identity criteria generated by a geological process (fragmentation).","A volcanic clast is a lithoclast that is composed of igneous material derived from the fragmentation of volcanic rocks. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these clasts typically originate from syn-rift basalts and trachytes and can be reworked into the carbonate depositional system. Their presence within reservoir facies, such as coquinas or microbialites, can significantly influence local diagenetic pathways and reservoir quality."
anticline,Sedimentary Structure,"The NLD defines an anticline as a 'fold-related structural trap,' which describes a pattern of the internal arrangement of rock layers, fitting the definition of a Sedimentary Structure.","An anticline is a fold-related structural trap that is convex upward with stratigraphically older rocks in its core. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt province, these features are typically large, low-relief, four-way dip closures that host significant hydrocarbon accumulations in sag-phase microbial carbonate reservoirs. The structural integrity and sealing capacity of these anticlines are critically dependent on the overlying Aptian evaporite sequence."
asthenospheric uplift,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geodynamic process' involving the upward movement of mantle material, which modifies the shape and arrangement of geological objects like the lithosphere and crust.","Asthenospheric uplift is a geodynamic process that involves the upward movement of hot, buoyant mantle material, which causes thermal doming, lithospheric thinning, and crustal extension. In the context of the South Atlantic, this mechanism is the primary driver for the continental rifting that formed the precursor basins to the Brazilian Pre-Salt province. The associated high heat flow is a critical element for the maturation of the lacustrine source rocks within the Pre-Salt petroleum system."
basin evolution,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geodynamic process' that describes the integrated tectonic, sedimentary, and thermal history of a basin, which modifies geological objects over time.","Basin evolution is a geodynamic process that describes the integrated tectonic, sedimentary, and thermal history of a basin through its rift, sag, and drift phases. This tectono-stratigraphic framework governs the formation, architecture, and temporal development of all petroleum system elements. It specifically controls the deposition of pre-salt source rocks and microbial carbonate reservoirs, their burial history, and the ultimate timing of hydrocarbon generation and accumulation."
bivalve rudstone,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'grain-supported carbonate rock' composed of a collection of sedimentary particles (bivalve shells), which directly matches the definition of a Sedimentary Rock.","A bivalve rudstone is a grain-supported carbonate rock that is composed of a framework of bivalve shells and fragments deposited in high-energy, shallow lacustrine settings, forming a key Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoir facies. Its excellent reservoir quality results from significant secondary porosity generated by the diagenetic dissolution of the shells, creating an effective moldic and vuggy pore system."
carbonate sequence,Depositional System,"The NLD defines the term as a 'depositional sequence' composed of 'genetically related carbonate strata,' which aligns with the definition of a Depositional System as an aggregate of linked depositional units.","A carbonate sequence is a depositional sequence that is predominantly composed of genetically related carbonate strata bounded by unconformities or their correlative conformities. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these sequences are characterized by thick successions of lacustrine microbialites and spherulites deposited during the sag phase of continental rifting. These stratigraphic packages form the primary reservoir intervals, with their internal architecture and quality controlled by high-frequency cycles of lake-level fluctuation."
continental flood basalt,Geological Object,"The NLD defines this as an 'extensive succession of... volcanic rocks', which is a rigid entity with its own identity and unity, generated by a geological process (volcanic eruption).","A continental flood basalt is an extensive succession of subaerially erupted, mafic volcanic rocks that covers vast areas of a continent and is associated with mantle plume activity during continental rifting. In the Brazilian Santos and Campos basins, this succession forms the Aptian-age economic basement whose emplacement and subsequent cooling critically influenced the thermal maturation of the overlying Pre-Salt source rocks. The weathered and fractured top of these basalts can occasionally constitute a secondary reservoir target."
discontinuity,Geological Boundary,"The NLD defines the term as a 'planar or curviplanar surface' representing a 'break in the continuity,' which directly aligns with the definition of a Geological Boundary as a physical discontinuity.","A discontinuity is a planar or curviplanar surface within a rock mass that represents a mechanical, stratigraphic, or diagenetic break in the continuity of geological properties. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these features most commonly manifest as faults, fracture corridors, unconformities, and stylolitic seams. Such surfaces critically control the geometry, compartmentalization, and fluid flow properties of the carbonate reservoirs."
exploratory well,object,"The NLD describes a well as a physical, engineered entity that is drilled, which fits the BFO definition of a material entity with causal unity, rather than a natural geological feature.","An exploratory well is a petroleum well that is drilled to test an unproven geological prospect and discover a new hydrocarbon accumulation. It is the first well drilled in a frontier area or new play to confirm the presence of a viable petroleum system, such as the pioneering wells that targeted the microbial carbonate reservoirs beneath the salt layer in Brazil. This type of well is characterized by the highest geological uncertainty and financial risk, as its primary goal is to acquire critical subsurface data to de-risk a potential discovery."
fault plane,Geological Boundary,"The NLD defines the term as a 'planar discontinuity' and a 'surface' between adjacent rock blocks, which directly corresponds to the definition of a Geological Boundary as a physical discontinuity on the external surface of a Geological Object.","A fault plane is a planar discontinuity that represents the surface of shear displacement between two adjacent rock blocks. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, these are typically listric normal faults formed during the syn-rift phase, defining the geometry of half-grabens where source and reservoir rocks were deposited. The sealing or conductive nature of this surface, often through juxtaposition against Aptian salt or other non-reservoir units, is a critical element controlling hydrocarbon migration and trap formation."
fault zone,Geological Structure,"The NLD defines a fault zone as a 'system of interconnected faults and associated fractures,' which directly aligns with the definition of a Geological Structure as the internal arrangement and configuration of a Geological Object.","A fault zone is a tabular volume of rock that accommodates significant shear displacement through a system of interconnected faults and associated fractures. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these zones are predominantly rift-related normal faults that define the horst and graben structures forming the primary hydrocarbon traps. They critically influence the petroleum system by acting as conduits for hydrocarbon migration from source to reservoir, creating permeability anisotropy, and forming barriers that result in reservoir compartmentalization."
fine-grained carbonate,Sedimentary Rock,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'carbonate sedimentary rock' constituted by a collection of sedimentary particles.,"A fine-grained carbonate is a carbonate sedimentary rock that is composed predominantly of particles smaller than 62.5 micrometers, including micrite and microbially-mediated precipitates like spherulites. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these rocks form the principal reservoir facies within a unique lacustrine depositional system. Their reservoir quality is controlled by a complex interplay between primary interparticle porosity and extensive diagenetic modification, such as dissolution."
fold,Geological Structure,"The NLD explicitly defines a fold as a 'geological structure' describing the arrangement of rock surfaces, which directly aligns with the GeoCore category that even lists 'fold' as an example.","A fold is a geological structure that results from the ductile bending of originally planar rock surfaces, such as sedimentary layers. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt province, these features are predominantly gentle, large-wavelength structures formed by salt movement or draping over basement topography. Their crestal culminations create the structural closures essential for trapping vast hydrocarbon accumulations in the carbonate reservoirs."
frequency,quality,"The NLD defines frequency as a 'seismic attribute that quantifies the rate of oscillation,' which aligns with the BFO definition of a quality as a characteristic that inheres in a bearer (in this case, a seismic wave).","Frequency is a fundamental seismic attribute that quantifies the rate of oscillation of a seismic wave, directly governing the vertical resolution for imaging geological features. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, its analysis is critical for delineating the complex internal architecture of carbonate reservoirs. Spectral decomposition and other frequency-based analyses are employed to distinguish reservoir facies, such as microbialites and coquinas, and to identify fluid-related anomalies."
horizon,Geological Boundary,"The NLD defines a horizon as an interpreted surface that represents a geological boundary between adjacent rock layers, which directly matches the category definition.","A horizon is an interpreted surface on seismic data that corresponds to a continuous reflection generated by a contrast in acoustic impedance between adjacent rock layers. This surface is used to map the three-dimensional geometry of key petroleum system elements, such as the base of the salt layer or the top of the pre-salt carbonate reservoirs. It represents a geological boundary or a chronostratigraphically significant event."
isopach map,Facies,"The NLD describes an isopach map as a visual representation (a contour map) that illustrates a property (thickness) of a geological object, which aligns with the definition of a Facies as a visual pattern of properties.","An isopach map is a contour map that illustrates the true stratigraphic thickness of a geological unit. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is a critical tool used to delineate the geometry of lacustrine carbonate reservoirs and to quantify gross rock volume for volumetric estimations. The map is constructed by contouring thickness values measured perpendicular to bedding planes, which are derived from the integrated interpretation of seismic and well log data."
lithospheric stretching,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geodynamic process' that modifies a geological object (the lithosphere), which directly aligns with the definition of a Geological Process.","Lithospheric stretching is a geodynamic process that results from extensional tectonic forces causing the horizontal extension and vertical thinning of the continental lithosphere. This process leads to the formation of rift basins through crustal faulting and thermally-driven subsidence. In the South Atlantic, this mechanism was fundamental for creating the accommodation space and high heat flow regime necessary for the deposition and preservation of the Pre-Salt lacustrine source rocks and carbonate reservoirs."
mineralogical composition,quality,"The NLD defines the term as a 'fundamental property of a geological material,' which directly corresponds to the BFO definition of a quality that inheres in an independent continuant.","Mineralogical composition is a fundamental property of a geological material that defines the identity and relative abundance of its constituent mineral phases. In Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, this property primarily quantifies the proportions of depositional carbonates, authigenic magnesium-silicate clays, and associated evaporitic minerals. This assemblage is a primary control on the rock's petrophysical and geomechanical behavior, directly impacting reservoir quality."
pre-salt succession,Depositional System,"The NLD describes a 'tectono-stratigraphic sequence' that encompasses multiple rock types (source rocks, reservoirs), fitting the definition of an aggregate of mereotopologically linked depositional units.",A pre-salt succession is a tectono-stratigraphic sequence of Late Barremian to Early Aptian age that encompasses the primary source rocks and microbial-bioclastic carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system. It was deposited in a lacustrine to transitional marine environment during the late-rift to sag phases of the South Atlantic opening. This succession is stratigraphically confined between the base of the Aptian salt layer above and a regional unconformity below.
prograding geometry,Sedimentary Structure,"The NLD defines the term as a 'stratigraphic pattern' resulting from the arrangement of depositional units (clinoforms), which fits the definition of a pattern of internal arrangement.","A prograding geometry is a stratigraphic pattern that results from the lateral, basinward outbuilding of a depositional system when the rate of sediment accumulation exceeds the rate of accommodation creation. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this geometry is characterized by inclined clinoforms of high-energy carbonates, such as coquinas or microbialites, that downlap onto lacustrine source rocks and form the main reservoir bodies."
salt structure,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as a 'subsurface geological body' composed of 'evaporitic rocks,' which are a type of sedimentary rock, directly aligning with this category's definition.","A salt structure is a subsurface geological body that is composed of mobile evaporitic rocks, primarily halite, and results from the deformation of a mother salt layer due to halokinesis. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these allochthonous or autochthonous bodies form the primary regional seal and create the structural closures for the underlying carbonate reservoirs. The high thermal conductivity of these structures also critically influences the thermal maturation history of the Aptian source rocks and the heat flow into the post-salt section."
seismic response,Sedimentary Facies,"The NLD describes it as a geophysical representation of subsurface properties like lithology, porosity, and fluid content, which constitutes a pattern of sedimentological characteristics of depositional units.","A seismic response is a geophysical representation of the subsurface that is generated by the reflection of seismic waves at interfaces with contrasting acoustic impedance. These impedance contrasts are primarily driven by variations in lithology, porosity, and fluid content. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is the fundamental data used to interpret the complex architecture of carbonate reservoirs and to differentiate between hydrocarbon and CO2 accumulations."
seismic unit,Depositional Unit,"The NLD describes a mappable entity corresponding to a package of genetically related strata, which aligns with the definition of a Depositional Unit as a mappable Sedimentary Geological Object.","A seismic unit is a mappable seismo-stratigraphic entity that is bounded by seismic reflectors interpreted as chronostratigraphic surfaces and is characterized by a distinct internal seismic facies. This entity is inferred to correspond to a package of genetically related strata, such as the microbialite or coquina reservoir intervals within the sag phase of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
stratigraphic sequence,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines it as a 'fundamental stratigraphic unit' comprising a 'succession of strata,' which fits the definition of a mappable Sedimentary Geological Object.","A stratigraphic sequence is a fundamental stratigraphic unit that comprises a genetically related succession of strata deposited during a single cycle of relative base-level change in a rift setting. It is bounded by unconformities or their correlative conformities, which in the Brazilian Pre-Salt often represent surfaces of subaerial exposure, tectonic erosion, or major lacustrine flooding. The internal architecture of these sequences governs the primary distribution and quality of lacustrine carbonate reservoirs and associated source and seal facies."
structural domain,Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as a 'major crustal region' with a distinct identity based on its structural framework and tectonic history, which aligns with the definition of a Geological Object.","A structural domain is a major crustal region of a rifted margin that is characterized by a distinct structural framework and tectonic history, typically bounded by reactivated basement fault systems. This framework directly controls the rift architecture, the depositional fairways of pre-salt source rocks and microbial carbonate reservoirs, and the subsequent evolution of the salt layer."
syncline,Geological Structure,"The NLD defines a syncline as a 'structural fold,' which directly corresponds to the GeoCore category 'Geological Structure' that describes the internal arrangement of a Geological Object and lists 'fold' as an example.","A syncline is a structural fold that is concave-upward and contains the youngest rock strata in its core. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, synclines in the overburden, often formed by salt withdrawal, act as critical depocenters for clastic reservoirs and focus hydrocarbon migration from underlying source rocks."
transgression,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geological process' that modifies the arrangement of depositional systems by causing coastline migration.,"A transgression is a geological process of relative base-level rise that causes the landward migration of a coastline. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process causes the retrogradation of depositional systems, often terminating the growth of lacustrine carbonate reservoirs and resulting in a stratigraphic succession where deeper-water facies overlie shallower-water facies."
abiotic origin,Geological Process,"The NLD defines the term as a 'genesis... that results from inorganic physicochemical processes,' which directly aligns with the definition of a Geological Process that generates geological materials.","An abiotic origin is a genesis of a geological material or fluid component that results from inorganic physicochemical processes, independent of the direct metabolic activity of organisms. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this term primarily describes the precipitation of carbonate reservoir facies from supersaturated lacustrine brines and the contribution of mantle-derived gases, such as CO2, to the petroleum system."
biofilm,object aggregate,"The NLD defines a biofilm as a 'microbial community,' which is a material entity consisting of a plurality of objects (microbes) that together form a single unit.","A biofilm is a matrix-enclosed microbial community that adheres to a substrate and mediates carbonate biomineralization by trapping and binding particles. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine setting, these biofilms constitute the fundamental organic framework for the growth of microbialite buildups. Their metabolic activity is a primary control on the development of high-porosity reservoir facies."
clotted texture,Sedimentary Structure,"The NLD defines the term as a 'fabric' and a 'framework of... aggregates,' which represents a pattern of internal arrangement within a sedimentary rock, fitting the definition of a Sedimentary Structure.","A clotted texture is a primary to early diagenetic carbonate fabric that is defined by a framework of poorly sorted, mesoscopic aggregates of microcrystalline calcite or aragonite. These aggregates, often termed mesoclots, are typically of microbial or organo-mineral origin and are separated by inter-clot porosity or cement. This fabric is characteristic of the thrombolitic facies found in Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs."
fan delta,Depositional System,"The NLD explicitly defines a fan delta as a 'depositional system', which is a direct match for the GeoReservoir category.","A fan delta is a clastic depositional system that is formed by the direct progradation of a coarse-grained alluvial fan into a standing body of water, typically a lake within a tectonically active rift basin. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these systems constitute significant clastic reservoirs sourced from uplifted rift shoulders, often interfingering with lacustrine source rocks and carbonate buildups."
gel,Sediment,"The NLD describes the term as a 'precursor material' and 'protolith' that precipitated and was later transformed into rock, which aligns with the definition of an unconsolidated earth material that forms sedimentary rock.",A gel is a magnesium silicate hydrate protolith that precipitated from alkaline lacustrine waters and subsequently transformed through diagenesis into the unique carbonate reservoir rocks of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. This largely amorphous precursor material is considered the primary substance that generated the complex microbial and abiotic reservoir facies.
petroleum province,object aggregate,"The NLD defines it as a 'group of genetically related basins' and a 'collection of fields and accumulations', which aligns with the definition of an object aggregate as a plurality of objects forming a unit.","A petroleum province is a large-scale geological region that encompasses a sedimentary basin or a group of genetically related basins sharing a common tectono-sedimentary history. This shared geological framework governs the formation of one or more petroleum systems, resulting in a collection of fields and accumulations with similar origins and characteristics. The Santos Basin, which hosts the extensive lacustrine source-to-carbonate reservoir system of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, is a prime example of such a province."
platform top,Geological Boundary,"The NLD defines the term as a 'regional stratigraphic surface' and an 'unconformity', which is a physical discontinuity on the external surface of a geological object.","A platform top is a regional stratigraphic surface that marks the cessation of shallow-water carbonate deposition at the end of the sag phase in Brazilian Pre-Salt basins. This surface represents a key seismic marker that separates the Aptian carbonate reservoir succession, such as the Barra Velha Formation, from the overlying evaporitic sequence. It often corresponds to a major unconformity or a terminal drowning surface, signifying a basin-wide change in depositional conditions."
reef,Mound Unit,"The NLD describes a reef as a 'carbonate buildup' with 'topographic relief,' which aligns with the definition of a Mound Unit as a Depositional Unit having Mound Geometry.","A reef is an in-situ carbonate buildup that possesses a rigid organic framework and topographic relief, capable of resisting wave action. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, these buildups are typically microbial-dominated bioconstructions of Aptian age that form highly porous and permeable reservoir intervals."
sepiolite,Earth Material,"The NLD describes sepiolite as a 'clay mineral' that precipitates and infills pores, which is a natural amount of solid matter generated by a geological process.","Sepiolite is an authigenic clay mineral that precipitates directly from the alkaline, magnesium- and silicon-rich lacustrine waters characteristic of the Brazilian Pre-Salt sag phase. It is commonly found as fibrous crystals infilling pores and replacing grains within Aptian microbial carbonate facies. This occurrence significantly degrades reservoir quality by creating extensive microporosity that hosts irreducible water and occludes pore throats, thereby reducing permeability."
shallow marine environment,site,"The NLD defines a depositional environment as a location whose boundaries are determined by its relation to material entities (e.g., continental shelf) and physical conditions, fitting the definition of a site.","A shallow marine environment is a depositional environment that is situated on a continental shelf or carbonate platform within the photic zone and above storm wave base, where sedimentation is controlled by wave, tide, and current activity. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these environments are primarily associated with the post-salt carbonate platform successions which form important secondary reservoirs and regional seals."
silt,Sediment,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'clastic sediment' composed of particles, which directly matches the definition of the Sediment category as an unconsolidated earth material.","Silt is a clastic sediment that is defined by a particle size intermediate between sand and clay, ranging from 4 to 62.5 micrometers. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine carbonate system, these fine-grained siliciclastic or detrital carbonate deposits form low-permeability layers that act as baffles to fluid flow. Such layers can significantly impact reservoir connectivity and compartmentalization."
alteration,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines alteration as a 'post-depositional process that modifies the mineralogical composition, texture, or fabric of a rock', which directly matches the definition of a Geological Process.","Alteration is any post-depositional process that modifies the mineralogical composition, texture, or fabric of a rock. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these processes, chiefly diagenesis and hydrothermalism, are the fundamental controls on the creation, destruction, and redistribution of porosity and permeability in carbonate reservoirs."

This fabric is interpreted as a product of microbial and physicochemical precipitation in highly alkaline lacustrine systems. Its growth framework is a primary control on the development of high-quality reservoir porosity in the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
depositional architecture,Depositional System,"The NLD describes a 'three-dimensional framework of genetically related depositional elements' and their 'stacking patterns,' which aligns with the definition of a Depositional System as an aggregate of mereotopologically linked Depositional Units.","Depositional architecture is the three-dimensional framework of genetically related depositional elements that results from sedimentary processes within a basin. This framework defines the geometry, continuity, and stacking patterns of facies bodies, such as the lacustrine carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. It is a primary control on the distribution and connectivity of petroleum system elements."
extensional basin,Geological Object,The NLD defines it as a 'structural basin' which is a distinct physical entity formed by a geological process (stretching and thinning of the lithosphere).,"An extensional basin is a structural basin that is formed by the stretching and thinning of the lithosphere in response to divergent tectonic forces. This process creates accommodation space through subsidence and is characterized by normal faulting, which develops the horst-and-graben framework essential for the deposition of the source rocks and reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
fault pattern,Geological Structure,"The NLD defines the term as a 'structural configuration defined by the spatial arrangement, orientation, and connectivity' of faults, which aligns with the definition of a Geological Structure as the internal arrangement and configuration of a Geological Object.","A fault pattern is a structural configuration defined by the spatial arrangement, orientation, and connectivity of a set of genetically related faults. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this configuration is predominantly a system of normal faults inherited from the South Atlantic rift phase, creating the horst-and-graben topography essential for the deposition of both lacustrine source rocks and carbonate reservoirs. This primary rift fabric is frequently modified by subsequent halokinesis, impacting final trap geometry and hydrocarbon migration pathways."
footwall,Geological Object,"The NLD defines a footwall as a 'fault block,' which is a rigid entity with its own identity and unity, generated by a geological process (faulting), fitting the definition of a Geological Object.","A footwall is a fault block that lies structurally beneath an inclined fault plane. In the extensional tectonic regime of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, the footwall represents the relatively uplifted block that forms structural highs, such as horsts and tilted blocks. These structural culminations are critical exploration targets as they commonly host the main microbialite and coquina carbonate reservoirs."
geometry,Geometry,"The NLD defines the term as a set of attributes that defines the external shape and form of a rock body, which directly aligns with the definition of Geometry as a quality inhering in a unit by virtue of its external three-dimensional shape.","Geometry is a set of three-dimensional attributes that defines the external shape, internal architecture, and spatial arrangement of a rock body. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it specifically characterizes the form of lacustrine carbonate reservoirs, the configuration of structural traps beneath the salt, and the complex morphology of the overlying evaporite sequence. The accurate definition of these geometries is fundamental for seismic interpretation and the calculation of in-place hydrocarbon volumes."
internal reflector,Geological Boundary,"The NLD defines the term as a 'mappable seismic interface' and a 'surface of significant acoustic impedance contrast', which corresponds to a physical discontinuity, fitting the definition of a Geological Boundary.","An internal reflector is a mappable seismic interface that represents a surface of significant acoustic impedance contrast occurring within the boundaries of a larger, genetically related stratigraphic unit. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs, these reflectors often correspond to geological features such as diagenetic fronts, layers of volcanic rock, or fine-grained siliciclastic deposits interbedded within the main reservoir succession. The characterization of these surfaces is critical as they can act as significant baffles or barriers to fluid flow, controlling reservoir compartmentalization."
lineament,Geological Structure,"The NLD defines a lineament as the mappable expression of an underlying geological discontinuity, such as a fault system or shear zone, which are types of geological structures.","A lineament is a mappable linear or curvilinear feature, identified on geophysical data, that represents the expression of an underlying geological discontinuity. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it typically corresponds to a basement-involved fault system or shear zone that was reactivated during the South Atlantic rifting phase. Such features are fundamental to exploration as they control the rift architecture, the location of structural highs, and the fracture patterns within the carbonate reservoirs."
lithostratigraphy,generically dependent continuant,"The NLD defines lithostratigraphy as a 'sub-discipline' and 'framework' for organizing rock units, which represents a conceptual pattern or content that can be copied and applied, rather than a physical object or process.","Lithostratigraphy is the sub-discipline of stratigraphy that organizes sedimentary rock successions into mappable units based on their distinct physical and petrographic characteristics, independent of their inferred geologic age or mode of origin. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this framework is essential for correlating genetically distinct carbonate reservoir bodies, such as the microbialite and coquina facies within the Barra Velha Formation, across a basin. This correlation provides the fundamental geometric architecture for building static reservoir models."
neoproterozoic,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD defines the term as a 'geologic era... that spans from 1000 to 541 million years ago,' which is a specific interval of geological time.","Neoproterozoic is a geologic era of the Proterozoic Eon that spans from 1000 to 541 million years ago. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt province, this term refers to the metamorphic and igneous crystalline basement complex formed during the Brasiliano-Pan-African orogeny. The structural fabric and paleotopography of this basement exerted a primary control on the location and evolution of the Mesozoic rift basins that contain the Pre-Salt petroleum systems."
oceanic anoxic event,Geological Process,"The NLD describes it as a geologically brief interval involving a series of processes, such as widespread anoxia and deposition, that are fundamental to the formation of geological objects like petroleum source rocks.","An oceanic anoxic event is a geologically brief interval of widespread marine anoxia that is recorded in the stratigraphic record by the deposition of organic-rich sediments. These episodes are linked to major perturbations in the global carbon cycle and are fundamental to the formation of prolific petroleum source rocks. In the context of the Brazilian margin, they are responsible for the world-class source rocks deposited during the Aptian sag phase."
precambrian basement,Geological Object,"The NLD describes it as a 'crustal complex' of rocks that acts as a structural floor, which fits the definition of a rigid entity with its own identity and unity criteria.","A Precambrian basement is a crustal complex of predominantly igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks that underlies the Phanerozoic sedimentary successions of the Brazilian continental margin. Within the Pre-Salt petroleum system, this complex acts as the economic and structural floor, with its paleotopography controlling the initial deposition of rift-phase source and reservoir rocks. It is generally considered non-productive, although its weathered and fractured top may occasionally possess secondary reservoir potential."
reworked deposit,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines it as a 'sedimentary body' that is 'redeposited' and forms mappable features like 'shoals' and 'reservoir intervals', fitting the definition of a Depositional Unit.","A reworked deposit is a carbonate sedimentary body that is constituted by clasts, such as spherulites, bioclasts, or intraclasts, which were eroded from a primary depositional site and subsequently redeposited by high-energy lacustrine processes. This reworking typically winnows out the fine-grained matrix, resulting in well-sorted facies with enhanced porosity and permeability. Such deposits form prolific reservoir intervals in the Brazilian Pre-Salt, commonly occurring as grainstone shoals on structural highs or along lake margins."
shallow marine setting,site,"The NLD defines a 'depositional environment' as a location with specific characteristics, which corresponds to a site, a three-dimensional immaterial entity defined in relation to material entities.","A shallow marine setting is a depositional environment characterized by seawater of normal salinity, located on a continental shelf or carbonate platform at depths typically within the photic zone. Within the petroleum system of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this setting is exemplified by the post-salt Albian-Cenomanian carbonates that form the critical regional seal above the Aptian salt and lacustrine reservoirs."
shoreface,site,"The NLD defines a 'depositional environment,' which is a location defined by specific boundaries where geological processes occur, fitting the BFO definition of a site.","A shoreface is a depositional environment that is situated along the margin of the Pre-Salt lacustrine system, extending from the fair-weather wave base to the low-water mark. It is characterized by high hydrodynamic energy that reworks and sorts carbonate sediments, forming high-quality reservoirs such as coquinas and grainstones."

Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this architecture is primarily controlled by the interplay between accommodation and sediment supply in a lacustrine setting, reflecting climatic and tectonic-driven lake-level fluctuations. It governs the three-dimensional distribution and connectivity of reservoir facies, such as microbialites and coquinas, making it a critical concept for reservoir characterization and modeling."
supersequence,Depositional System,"The NLD defines a supersequence as a 'succession of genetically related depositional sequences,' which aligns with the definition of a Depositional System as an aggregate of linked depositional units.","A supersequence is a first-order tectono-stratigraphic unit that comprises a succession of genetically related depositional sequences bounded by regionally extensive unconformities. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these units represent the principal phases of Aptian sag basin evolution, driven by major tectonic and climatic shifts. They typically encompass the key elements of the lacustrine petroleum system, including source, reservoir, and regional seal intervals."
tectonic quiescence,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD defines the term as a 'geological interval' and a 'critical period' characterized by specific geological processes, which directly aligns with the definition of a Geological Time Interval.","Tectonic quiescence is a post-rift geological interval that is characterized by a minimal rate of crustal deformation and is dominated by slow, regional thermal subsidence. This stage creates the stable, low-gradient accommodation space essential for the widespread development of the Brazilian Pre-Salt's lacustrine carbonate reservoir systems. It represents the critical period of basin stability between the active syn-rift faulting phase and the onset of major salt deposition and halokinesis."
tectonic regime,Geological Process,"The NLD defines it as a geodynamic setting involving stresses and deformation that controls the creation and architecture of geological features, which is a type of process that modifies geological objects.","A tectonic regime is a geodynamic setting that is defined by the dominant type and orientation of crustal stresses and the resulting style of geological deformation over a specific geological time interval. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, the evolution from an extensional rift regime to a post-rift thermal sag regime fundamentally controlled the creation of accommodation space, depositional architecture, and the primary structural framework of the petroleum system. These regimes directly influenced the deposition of both lacustrine source rocks and the subsequent extensive carbonate reservoir systems."
tectono-stratigraphy,generically dependent continuant,"The NLD defines the term as a 'geological subdiscipline' and a 'framework,' which is a shareable pattern of information or knowledge, fitting the definition of a generically dependent continuant.","Tectono-stratigraphy is a geological subdiscipline that defines large-scale stratigraphic units based on their genetic relationship to the tectonic evolution of a sedimentary basin. This framework is fundamental in the Brazilian Pre-Salt for differentiating the syn-rift successions, deposited in active grabens, from the overlying sag phase successions which host the regional microbial carbonate reservoirs. The resulting architecture, including the sealing Aptian salt, is the primary control on the distribution and geometry of the pre-salt petroleum system elements."
volcaniclastic,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a type of clastic rock composed of fragments, which is a kind of Sedimentary Rock.","A volcaniclastic rock is a type of clastic rock that is composed predominantly of fragments derived from volcanic activity. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these deposits are typically mafic syn-rift successions interbedded with lacustrine carbonates of the sag phase. They critically influence the petroleum system by acting as seals, affecting reservoir diagenesis, or constituting potential unconventional reservoirs."
angular unconformity,Geological Boundary,"The NLD defines the term as a surface that separates different rock strata, which aligns with the definition of a Geological Boundary as a physical discontinuity on the external surface of a Geological Object.","An angular unconformity is an unconformity that separates younger, relatively horizontal strata from older, underlying strata which were tilted, folded, and truncated by erosion prior to the deposition of the overlying sequence. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this feature is exemplified by the regional Break-up Unconformity, which separates the tilted syn-rift fault blocks from the overlying post-rift sag basin deposits containing the main carbonate reservoirs. This surface is a fundamental element of the petroleum system, often forming the upper seal for syn-rift traps or acting as a migration surface for hydrocarbons into the post-rift succession."
antecedent topography,Geological Boundary,"The NLD defines the term as a 'paleorelief' and a 'surface' of a substrate, which corresponds to a physical discontinuity on the external surface of a Geological Object.","Antecedent topography is a paleorelief of the pre-carbonate substrate that controlled the initial establishment and subsequent development of carbonate depositional systems. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this surface is typically formed on syn-rift volcanic and siliciclastic rocks. Its structural and geomorphological highs provided the preferential sites for the accumulation of high-quality microbialite and coquina reservoirs."
lacustrine carbonate system,Depositional System,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'depositional system' that develops within lakes and generates unique facies and accumulations.,"A lacustrine carbonate system is a depositional system that develops within large, saline to hypersaline lakes of continental rift settings, characterized by carbonate production dominated by microbial mediation and direct chemical precipitation. It generates unique facies, such as microbially-influenced spherulites and abiotic calcite shrubs, often interbedded with bioclastic accumulations like coquinas. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these systems form world-class petroleum reservoirs due to the development and preservation of exceptional porosity and permeability."

These geometric relationships, classified as onlap, downlap, or truncation, are fundamental for interpreting depositional sequences and unconformities. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, their analysis is critical for delineating the complex geometries of microbialite and coquina carbonate reservoirs and identifying key sequence boundaries within the rift and sag sections."
reworked spherulite,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines the term as a 'carbonate clast' or 'grain' formed by sedimentary processes like erosion and redeposition, which is a type of geological object constituted by sedimentary material.","A reworked spherulite is a carbonate clast that is formed by the erosion, transport, and subsequent redeposition of a primary, in-situ spherulite within the Pre-Salt lacustrine depositional system. These grains are fundamental components of high-energy, grain-supported facies that often constitute high-quality petroleum reservoirs. The process of reworking can modify the grain's original texture through abrasion and sorting, enhancing interparticle porosity."
sequence-stratigraphic architecture,Sedimentary Structure,"The NLD defines the term as a 'geometrical framework that describes the three-dimensional arrangement of depositional sequences', which fits the definition of a Sedimentary Structure as a pattern of the internal arrangement of Depositional Units.","Sequence-stratigraphic architecture is a geometrical framework that describes the three-dimensional arrangement of depositional sequences and their component systems tracts, as defined by key stratigraphic surfaces. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this architecture is primarily controlled by the interplay between tectonically-driven accommodation in a rift setting and high-frequency, climatically-induced lake-level fluctuations. This framework is critical as it governs the distribution, connectivity, and quality of lacustrine carbonate reservoir facies, thereby controlling the primary elements of the petroleum system."
supersaturation,quality,"The NLD defines supersaturation as a 'physicochemical condition of a fluid,' which is a state that inheres in a material entity (the fluid), fitting the BFO definition of a quality.","Supersaturation is a physicochemical condition of a fluid that contains a concentration of dissolved ions exceeding the equilibrium solubility product for a specific mineral phase. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this state in lacustrine brines is the primary driver for the widespread abiotic precipitation of carbonate reservoir facies. This condition is often induced by the mixing of alkaline surface waters with calcium-rich subsurface fluids."
alkaline lacustrine setting,Depositional System,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'continental depositional system', which is a direct match to this category.","An alkaline lacustrine setting is a continental depositional system that is characterized by a lake with a chemically stratified water column of high pH and alkalinity. This specific hydrochemistry, often developed within hydrologically closed rift basins, promotes the extensive development of microbial carbonate factories and abiotic mineral precipitation. Such conditions are fundamental to the coeval formation of the unique microbialite reservoirs and the organic-rich source rocks of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
chaotic seismic facies,Sedimentary Facies,"The NLD defines the term as a type of seismic facies, which is a pattern of properties representing the sedimentological characteristics of geological bodies.","A chaotic seismic facies is a seismic facies that is characterized by a disordered, discontinuous, and non-parallel internal reflection configuration with variable amplitudes.

This evidence includes the organo-sedimentary structures of microbialites, which form the main reservoir facies, and the preserved carapaces of microfossils like non-marine ostracods."
high-energy condition,Geological Process,"The NLD describes a 'depositional state' characterized by 'persistent and strong hydrodynamic forces' that transport, sort, and abrade grains, which is a physical process that modifies geological materials.","A high-energy condition is a depositional state that is characterized by persistent and strong hydrodynamic forces, such as wave and current action, capable of transporting, sorting, and abrading carbonate grains. This process effectively winnows away fine-grained sediments, resulting in the accumulation of clean, grain-supported fabrics like coquinas and grainstones. These facies typically exhibit high primary interparticle porosity and permeability, forming the most productive reservoir intervals in the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine successions."

They also occur as a significant diagenetic phase, often occluding porosity within the underlying carbonate reservoirs."
toplap,Sedimentary Structure,"The NLD defines toplap as a type of stratal termination, which is a pattern of the internal arrangement of depositional units.","Toplap is a stratal termination in which initially inclined strata, such as carbonate clinoforms, terminate against a less inclined upper boundary due to non-deposition. This geometric relationship typically marks a sequence boundary where the rate of deposition could not keep pace with the rate of accommodation creation, effectively defining the upper limit of a depositional sequence. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, toplap is a key seismic-stratigraphic feature used to delineate the upper boundary of prograding microbialite or coquina reservoir bodies."

margin basin,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as a 'sedimentary basin' filled with sedimentary sequences, which is a type of geological object constituted by sedimentary rock and sediment.","A margin basin is a sedimentary basin that forms along the transition between continental and oceanic crust, initiated by continental rifting and followed by thermal subsidence after the onset of seafloor spreading. These basins, such as the Santos and Campos Basins, are characterized by distinct rift, sag, and drift sequences. They host the prolific lacustrine carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system within their syn-rift and early post-rift successions."
supercontinent,Geological Object,"The NLD defines a supercontinent as a 'continental landmass' composed of 'continental blocks', fitting the definition of a rigid entity with its own identity criteria that is generated by a geological process (plate tectonics).","A supercontinent is a continental landmass that comprises the majority of Earth's continental blocks, whose tectonic breakup initiates the formation of new ocean basins and their associated passive margins. The fragmentation of the Gondwana supercontinent, for example, directly controlled the creation of the restricted rift basins where the key elements of the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system were deposited. This process established the fundamental structural and stratigraphic framework for the source, reservoir, and seal rocks."

It typically forms on substrates within alkaline lacustrine environments and is widely interpreted as a microbially-influenced precipitate. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these crusts constitute the primary framework of high-porosity microbialite reservoirs, critically controlling reservoir quality."
fluorite,Earth Material,"The NLD describes fluorite as a mineral composed of calcium fluoride that occurs as a cement, which is a natural amount of solid matter generated by a geological process (hydrothermal fluid flow).","Fluorite is a halide mineral composed of calcium fluoride (CaF₂) that, within Brazilian Pre-Salt successions, typically occurs as a late-stage hydrothermal cement which occludes porosity in carbonate reservoirs. It is a key indicator of high-temperature fluid flow through the petroleum system, often associated with deep-seated faults and magmatic intrusions. This mineral's presence can significantly reduce reservoir quality by cementing fractures and vugs."
illite,Earth Material,"The NLD defines illite as a mineral, which is a type of natural solid matter that serves as a primary component of rocks and shales.","Illite is a non-expanding, potassium-aluminum phyllosilicate mineral that is a primary component of the lacustrine source rocks and sealing shales of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its authigenic growth within reservoir facies, often characterized by a fibrous morphology, can severely impair permeability by bridging and occluding pore throats. The diagenetic transformation of smectite to illite within source rocks is a key mechanism for hydrocarbon expulsion."
intercrystalline porosity,site,"The NLD defines the term as 'void spaces located between the crystal faces,' which aligns with the BFO category 'site', a three-dimensional immaterial entity whose boundaries are determined by material entities.","Intercrystalline porosity is a secondary pore system that is defined by the void spaces located between the crystal faces of a crystalline carbonate fabric. In Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, it is predominantly formed by the dolomitization of precursor facies, such as microbialites and spherulites, creating a well-connected network of pores between dolomite rhombs. This porosity type is a fundamental contributor to the high storage capacity and permeability that characterize these reservoirs."

This mass-transfer mechanism drives the dissolution of calcite and dolomite at stressed interfaces and their subsequent precipitation as cement in adjacent, lower-stress pore spaces. The process is a primary control on reservoir quality destruction, creating stylolites and solution seams that significantly reduce porosity and permeability."
primary constituent,Geological Object,"The NLD describes a textural component, such as a shell or spherulite, which is a discrete, rigid entity generated by geological processes that constitutes part of a sedimentary rock.","A primary constituent is a textural component that formed at or near the time of deposition and defines the original fabric of a sedimentary rock, such as the microbial spherulites and bivalve shells that form the framework of Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates.

Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is a fundamental control on reservoir quality, primarily through the cementation of microbialite and coquina facies by calcite, dolomite, or silica. This cementation, often driven by the mixing of hydrothermal fluids with lacustrine brines, typically reduces or occludes the original pore system."
post-deposition fault,Geological Structure,"The NLD defines the term as a 'brittle structural discontinuity' that displaces rock units, which aligns with the GeoCore definition of a Geological Structure, a category that explicitly lists 'fault' as an example.","A post-deposition fault is a brittle structural discontinuity that displaces a previously deposited stratigraphic unit, such as the lacustrine carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. This faulting, which postdates the primary depositional fabric, is typically driven by tectonic reactivation or halokinesis and is a primary control on reservoir compartmentalization. It critically influences fluid flow pathways and the final geometry of hydrocarbon accumulations by offsetting both reservoir and seal intervals."
shallow evaporitic lake,site,"The NLD defines the term as a 'depositional environment,' which is a place or setting where geological processes occur, fitting the BFO definition of a site as a three-dimensional entity whose boundaries are determined in relation to material entities.","A shallow evaporitic lake is a lacustrine depositional environment, characteristic of the South Atlantic Aptian rift, that is defined by evaporation rates exceeding water input.

paleoenvironmental condition,quality,"The NLD defines the term as a set of physical, chemical, and biological parameters like water chemistry, depth, and energy, which are qualities inhering in a depositional system.","A paleoenvironmental condition is a specific set of physical, chemical, and biological parameters that characterized a depositional system at a particular time in the geological past. These parameters, such as water chemistry, depth, and energy, directly governed the genesis, geometry, and petrophysical quality of sedimentary facies. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these conditions were critical in controlling the development of unique lacustrine carbonate reservoirs and the deposition of associated source rocks."
compartmentalization,Geological Structure,"The NLD describes a condition that subdivides a reservoir, which represents the internal arrangement and configuration of a geological object resulting from the interplay of faults and heterogeneities.","Compartmentalization is a geological condition that subdivides a reservoir into discrete volumes with restricted or no hydraulic communication. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this condition is primarily caused by the complex interplay of sealing faults, laterally extensive diagenetic bodies, and primary stratigraphic heterogeneities inherent to the microbial carbonate facies. These compartments are consequently defined by distinct pressure regimes, fluid contacts, and compositions, which are critical for hydrocarbon exploration and production."

In the lacustrine depositional systems of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this cortex is typically formed by microbial mediation or direct chemical precipitation from alkaline waters, creating fundamental grain types like oncoids and spherulites. These grains are critical constituents of high-energy shoal and shoreline reservoir facies."
collapse,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'diagenetic and gravitational process' that modifies the arrangement of rock strata.,"Collapse is a diagenetic and gravitational process that results from the failure and downward movement of overlying rock strata due to the dissolution of soluble carbonate or evaporitic layers during subaerial exposure. This process is fundamental to the formation of Pre-Salt reservoirs, creating chaotic breccias and sag structures whose reservoir quality is controlled by the resulting clast fabric and matrix properties."
colluvial wedge,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines the term as a 'sedimentary body' and a 'deposit' formed by accumulation, which is consistent with the definition of a Depositional Unit as a recognizable sedimentary geological object.","A colluvial wedge is a sedimentary body that is formed by the gravity-driven accumulation of poorly sorted clastic material into a wedge-shaped geometry at the base of a fault-bounded paleotopographic high. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt rift basins, its composition is typically polymictic, comprising angular fragments of igneous, metamorphic, or carbonate rocks derived from the adjacent uplifted block.

It is formed by the in-situ alteration of magnesium-silicate precursors within the lacustrine carbonate succession of the Barra Velha Formation. This low-permeability lithofacies acts as a critical vertical flow barrier, compartmentalizing the main reservoir bodies."
silicified,Geological Process,"The NLD defines silicification as a diagenetic process where silica minerals replace or precipitate within a pre-existing rock, modifying its composition.","A silicified rock is a rock that has undergone a diagenetic process where silica minerals, such as quartz or chalcedony, replace pre-existing minerals or precipitate as cement within pore spaces. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this alteration predominantly affects lacustrine carbonate facies, particularly microbialites, by replacing the original calcite or dolomite framework. This process critically controls reservoir quality by generally occluding the pore system and reducing permeability, though it can occasionally enhance rock strength to preserve porosity during burial."

In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, cuttings are fundamental for identifying complex carbonate facies and detecting hydrocarbon shows in the reservoir section."
detrital clay,Sediment,"The NLD defines it as a component consisting of transported, clay-sized mineral particles, which aligns with the definition of Sediment as an unconsolidated earth material made of sedimentary grains.","Detrital clay is a siliciclastic component that consists of clay-sized phyllosilicate minerals transported from a terrigenous source area into the depositional basin. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this component is primarily sourced from the erosion of rift shoulders, and its presence within lacustrine carbonate facies significantly degrades reservoir quality by occluding pore space. It is distinguished from authigenic clay, which precipitates in-situ during diagenesis."
flooding event,Geological Process,"The NLD describes it as a stratigraphic event involving a rise in base level and transgression that modifies the arrangement of depositional facies, fitting the definition of a process that modifies geological objects.","A flooding event is a stratigraphic event that marks a rapid, relative rise in lacustrine base level, causing the submergence of a previously established carbonate platform. This transgression shifts depositional facies landward and terminates a shallowing-upward cycle. The event is recognized in the rock record as a flooding surface, which may separate reservoir-quality microbialites from overlying fine-grained, organic-rich source or seal facies."
flow rate,Geological Process,"The NLD describes a dynamic measure of fluid movement through a reservoir over time, which is a physical process that modifies the state of a geological system.","Flow rate is a dynamic reservoir property measure that quantifies the volume of fluid passing through a specific cross-sectional area per unit of time. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, it specifically refers to the volume of hydrocarbons and water moving through the complex pore network of carbonate reservoirs or a wellbore. This measure is essential for evaluating well deliverability and characterizing the hydraulic connectivity of reservoir facies like microbialites and coquinas."
intergranular porosity,site,"The NLD defines the term as the 'void space located between the constituent grains of a rock', which aligns with the BFO definition of a site as a 3D immaterial entity whose boundaries are determined by material entities.","Intergranular porosity is a type of primary porosity that constitutes the void space located between the constituent grains of a rock, such as the bioclasts in coquinas or the calcite spherules in spherulitic facies. This pore system represents the original, interconnected network formed at the time of deposition, prior to significant diagenetic alteration. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, the preservation of this porosity from early cementation is a fundamental control on reservoir quality and permeability."
isotopic fractionation,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'process' that modifies the composition of geological materials by partitioning isotopes, which aligns with the definition of a Geological Process.","Isotopic fractionation is a process that results in the relative partitioning of isotopes of an element between different substances or phases due to their mass-dependent differences in physicochemical properties. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this process is fundamental for interpreting the complex diagenetic history of lacustrine carbonate reservoirs by tracing the origin and temperature of formative fluids. It is also critical for determining the genesis of associated gases, such as CO₂, and for correlating hydrocarbons to their sag-phase source rocks."
lake floor,Geological Boundary,"The NLD defines the term as a 'depositional surface' that constitutes the 'bottom' of a lacustrine system, which is a type of physical discontinuity on the external surface of a geological object.","A lake floor is a subaqueous depositional surface that, within the Aptian sag basins of the South Atlantic, constituted the bottom of a stratified alkaline lacustrine system. This surface served as the primary site for the accumulation of organic-rich source rocks and as the substrate for the growth of microbial and bioclastic carbonate reservoirs."
late cretaceous,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD defines the term as a 'geological epoch,' which is a specific type of geological time interval during which geological processes like deposition occurred.","The Late Cretaceous is a geological epoch that, for the Brazilian Pre-Salt, corresponds to the post-rift thermal subsidence phase characterized by the deposition of the marine post-salt succession. This succession provides the regional seal and critical overburden for the maturation and trapping of hydrocarbons in the underlying petroleum systems."
marine water,Earth Fluid,"The NLD describes the term as a 'body of water' and an 'aqueous solution', which fits the definition of an Earth Material that is a volume of fluid.","Marine water is an aqueous solution that occupied the restricted sag basin during the Aptian rifting of the South Atlantic. This body of water was characterized by elevated salinity and high alkalinity, a specific chemical condition that governed the precipitation of the microbial carbonate reservoirs. Its progressive evaporation ultimately led to the deposition of the thick, overlying evaporitic section that forms the regional seal."
muddy sediment,Sediment,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as an 'unconsolidated sediment' composed of particles, which directly matches the definition of the Sediment category.","A muddy sediment is a fine-grained unconsolidated sediment that, in the Brazilian Pre-Salt, is composed predominantly of clay- and silt-sized carbonate particles, often of microbial origin. This material is characteristic of low-energy lacustrine depositional environments. It constitutes the primary matrix for organic-rich source rocks and forms low-permeability intervals that influence reservoir quality."
regional subsidence,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'large-scale geodynamic process' involving the downward movement of the lithosphere, which modifies the shape and arrangement of geological objects.","Regional subsidence is a large-scale geodynamic process that involves the long-term, downward movement of a broad area of the Earth's lithosphere. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is primarily driven by post-rift thermal contraction and isostatic loading from the thick sag basin succession. This subsidence created the critical accommodation space required for the deposition of the Aptian petroleum system, including the microbial carbonate reservoirs and the overlying regional salt seal."
sag interval,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines it as a 'tectono-stratigraphic unit' composed of sedimentary rocks ('source rocks and ... carbonate reservoirs'), which is a type of mappable Sedimentary Geological Object.","A sag interval is a tectono-stratigraphic unit that is deposited during the post-rift, pre-drift phase of basin evolution, driven by broad thermal subsidence. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this succession encompasses the primary lacustrine source rocks and prolific carbonate reservoirs of the Barremian-Aptian section. It is stratigraphically positioned between the underlying syn-rift sequence and the overlying regional Aptian salt seal, forming the core components of the play."
sand,Sediment,"The NLD defines sand as a 'clastic sedimentary particle' and discusses its 'accumulation', which directly aligns with the definition of Sediment as an 'Unconsolidated Earth Material constituted by some collection of sedimentary grains or particles'.","Sand is a clastic sedimentary particle that is defined by a grain diameter ranging from 62.5 micrometers to 2 millimeters. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum systems, these particles are predominantly of carbonate composition, such as bioclasts or ooids, rather than siliciclastic quartz. The accumulation of these sand-sized grains in high-energy depositional environments forms the grainstone and packstone facies that constitute the most significant high-quality reservoirs."
seawater,Earth Fluid,"The NLD defines seawater as an 'aqueous solution' and a 'fluid' that participates in geological processes, which directly corresponds to the definition of an Earth Fluid.","Seawater is an aqueous solution that functioned as the primary depositional and early diagenetic fluid during the formation of the Aptian carbonate reservoirs in the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its characteristically alkaline and saline-to-hypersaline geochemistry was the principal control on the precipitation of the non-skeletal, microbially-influenced carbonates that constitute these reservoirs. This fluid is the precursor to the connate formation brines found within the petroleum system."
stable isotope composition,quality,"The NLD defines this as a 'quantitative geochemical signature' and a 'ratio... in a material,' which is a property that inheres in a bearer, fitting the BFO definition of a quality.","A stable isotope composition is a quantitative geochemical signature that represents the ratio of heavy to light stable isotopes (e.g., δ¹³C, δ¹⁸O) in a material, which is used in Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates to trace the origin and temperature of diagenetic fluids that control reservoir quality."
topographic high,Geological Object,"The NLD describes it as a distinct, elevated paleogeomorphological feature composed of rock, which aligns with the definition of a rigid entity with its own identity criteria.","A topographic high is an elevated paleogeomorphological feature, typically composed of pre-rift basement rock, that exerted primary control on the depositional architecture and facies distribution of the overlying sag-phase lacustrine carbonate reservoirs. This feature forms the fundamental structural framework for the main hydrocarbon accumulations in the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
transport,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'sedimentary process' involving the movement of particles, which directly aligns with the definition of a Geological Process.","Transport is a sedimentary process that consists of the entrainment and movement of carbonate particles from a source to a depositional site by agents such as waves, currents, or gravity flows. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is fundamental in controlling the sorting, fabric, and geometry of reservoir facies like coquinas and grainstones. The resulting depositional architecture directly influences reservoir quality and heterogeneity."
basement structure,Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as a large-scale tectonic feature like a horst or graben, which is a rigid entity (a block of crust) generated by a geological process, fitting the definition of a Geological Object.","A basement structure is a large-scale tectonic feature, such as a horst or graben, formed within the Precambrian crystalline crust by Mesozoic rifting processes. This inherited structural relief created the fundamental paleotopography that controlled the depositional architecture of Pre-Salt source rocks and microbial carbonate reservoirs. These structural highs ultimately form the primary trapping mechanism for major hydrocarbon accumulations."
drift supersequence,Depositional System,"The NLD defines this term as a 'supersequence' that 'comprises the entire sedimentary succession', which fits the definition of an object aggregate whose members are linked depositional units.","A drift supersequence is a tectono-stratigraphic supersequence that comprises the entire sedimentary succession deposited during the post-rift thermal subsidence phase of a passive margin. In the Brazilian South Atlantic, this unit is bounded at its base by the breakup unconformity and includes the Aptian salt, which provides the regional seal and critical overburden for the underlying Pre-Salt petroleum systems. It encompasses all overlying marine carbonate and clastic deposits up to the modern seafloor."
extension direction,quality,"The NLD defines this term as a 'stress orientation,' which is an inherent property or characteristic that depends on a physical system (like a tectonic regime), fitting the BFO definition of a quality.","An extension direction is a principal horizontal stress orientation that is parallel to the minimum principal stress (σ3) and perpendicular to the strike of major normal faults within an extensional tectonic regime. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this orientation governed the development of the rift basins during the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. It is therefore a critical parameter for defining the structural grain of the basement, the geometry of syn-rift deposits, and the orientation of fracture systems within the carbonate reservoirs."
fault activity,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geological process' that involves displacement and controls the formation of various geological structures.,"Fault activity is a geological process that describes the displacement along a fault plane through a specific geological time interval. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is the primary mechanism controlling the formation of rift structures, the creation of accommodation space for carbonate reservoirs, and the development of hydrocarbon migration pathways and traps. This activity can be continuous or episodic, influencing both syn-rift and post-rift depositional and deformational events."
fauna,Sedimentary Facies,"The NLD describes the fauna as a fossil assemblage that characterizes sedimentary successions and is used for correlation, which aligns with the definition of a sedimentary facies as a pattern of properties of a depositional unit.","Fauna is a fossil assemblage of lacustrine animals that characterizes the Aptian successions of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Dominated by microfossils such as ostracods and bivalves, this assemblage is the primary tool for high-resolution biostratigraphic correlation and paleoenvironmental reconstruction of the carbonate reservoir systems. Its composition and preservation state are critical indicators of water salinity, oxygenation, and energy levels during reservoir deposition."
inversion,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines inversion as a 'structural geology process' that modifies geological objects by reversing fault slip and creating folds and uplifts.,"Inversion is a structural geology process that reverses the sense of slip on pre-existing extensional faults due to a change from a tensional to a compressional or transpressional stress regime. This reversal leads to the uplift and folding of the basin fill, transforming former grabens and half-grabens into structural highs. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this process is critical for the formation of large-scale anticlines that serve as the primary traps for hydrocarbon accumulations."
karstification,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as 'a geological process that creates secondary porosity and permeability in soluble rocks,' which directly aligns with the definition of a Geological Process.","Karstification is a geological process that creates secondary porosity and permeability in soluble rocks through their dissolution by acidic fluids. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is predominantly driven by meteoric water during periods of subaerial exposure, generating a complex network of vugs, conduits, and cave systems within the carbonate reservoirs. This diagenetic overprint is a primary control on reservoir heterogeneity and the development of high-productivity 'super-k' flow units."
magmatic intrusion,Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as a 'body of igneous rock', which is a rigid entity with its own identity and unity criteria, generated by a geological process (emplacement and crystallization).","A magmatic intrusion is a body of igneous rock that results from the emplacement and subsequent crystallization of magma within a pre-existing sedimentary succession. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these are predominantly Cenozoic features that intrude the Aptian carbonate reservoir section. Their presence critically impacts the petroleum system by creating localized thermal anomalies that affect source rock maturation, altering reservoir properties through diagenesis, and acting as barriers that compartmentalize hydrocarbon accumulations."
normal displacement,Dimension,"The NLD defines this term as a measured component of slip, which is a quality representing a one-dimensional extent that inheres in the fault system.","Normal displacement is the component of net slip measured parallel to the dip of a normal fault, where the hanging wall block has moved down relative to the footwall block. This displacement is the primary result of the extensional tectonic regime that formed the horst-and-graben structures fundamental to the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system. It creates the accommodation space for lacustrine source rocks and microbial carbonate reservoirs and can juxtapose these units against the regional salt seal."
post-rift stage,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD defines the term as a 'phase of basin evolution' that 'commences after' a specific event, which characterizes it as a temporal period during which geological processes occur.","The post-rift stage is a tectono-stratigraphic phase of basin evolution that commences after the cessation of active crustal extension and is primarily controlled by thermal subsidence. In the context of the South Atlantic margin, this stage encompasses the deposition of the Aptian sag section, which includes the Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs, and the overlying regional evaporitic seal. It is characterized by the development of a broad, thermally-driven sag basin architecture, contrasting with the preceding fault-bounded graben systems of the syn-rift."
pre-salt carbonate,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines the term as a 'succession of carbonate rocks,' which directly fits the definition of a geological object constituted by sedimentary rock.","A pre-salt carbonate is a succession of carbonate rocks that was deposited in a late Barremian to early Aptian lacustrine rift system, stratigraphically preceding the deposition of the main Aptian salt layer in Brazil's marginal basins. These rocks constitute the primary petroleum reservoirs of the pre-salt play, characterized by complex non-marine facies such as microbialites and spherulites. The reservoir quality is highly heterogeneous and is fundamentally controlled by the original depositional fabric and intense diagenetic overprinting."
pre-salt deposit,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines the term as a 'stratigraphic interval' comprising sedimentary rocks, which fits the definition of a large, mappable Sedimentary Geological Object.","A pre-salt deposit is a stratigraphic interval that comprises sedimentary rocks deposited during the sag phase of a continental rift, immediately preceding and underlying a major Aptian evaporitic sequence. This interval is characterized by extensive lacustrine carbonate systems, including microbialites and coquinas, which form the prolific petroleum reservoirs of the Brazilian continental margin."
prograding wedge,Depositional Unit,"The NLD describes it as a 'stratigraphic unit' formed by 'sedimentary deposits' with a specific geometry, which is consistent with the definition of a Depositional Unit.","A prograding wedge is a stratigraphic unit that possesses a wedge-shaped geometry formed by the basinward outbuilding of sedimentary deposits, characterized internally by sigmoidal to oblique clinoforms. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these wedges are typically composed of shallow-water carbonate facies, such as coquinas and microbialites, that build out over lacustrine source rocks. This geometry and composition make them critical reservoir elements within the petroleum system, often forming significant stratigraphic traps."
reactivation,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines reactivation as a 'tectonic process' that modifies geological structures, which directly aligns with the definition of a Geological Process.","Reactivation is a tectonic process that consists of the renewed displacement along a pre-existing structural weakness, such as a basement-involved rift fault, in response to a subsequent stress field. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is fundamental for creating and modifying the structural traps that host microbial carbonate reservoirs. Later reactivation events can also generate fracture networks that significantly enhance reservoir permeability."
seismic architecture,Sedimentary Structure,"The term is defined as a framework describing the three-dimensional arrangement and relationships of seismic facies, which corresponds to the pattern of the internal arrangement of depositional units.","Seismic architecture is a geological framework that describes the three-dimensional arrangement, geometry, and stratal relationships of seismic facies and reflection termination patterns within a seismic volume. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this framework is used to interpret the depositional systems and structural style of Aptian carbonate reservoirs and associated volcanic-sedimentary sequences. It is fundamental for delineating reservoir bodies, predicting their properties, and understanding the basin's evolution."
seismic line,generically dependent continuant,"The NLD defines a seismic line as a display of processed data, which is an informational artifact or pattern that can be copied and instantiated on various media, fitting the definition of a generically dependent continuant.","A seismic line is a two-dimensional vertical cross-section that displays processed acoustic reflection data to reveal the subsurface geological framework. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is the primary geophysical tool used to image through the complex Aptian salt layer to define the geometry of the Barremian carbonate reservoirs and associated hydrocarbon traps."

The signal's waveform is modified by reflection and transmission at geological interfaces, such as the complex salt bodies and heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs characteristic of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. These recorded modifications are fundamental for imaging subsurface structures and inferring reservoir properties."
sidewall core,object,"The term refers to a physical rock sample, which is a material entity with causal unity, but it is not a Geological Object as it is generated by a human mechanical process rather than a natural geological one.","A sidewall core is a cylindrical rock sample that is mechanically extracted from the wall of a borehole at a specific, pre-selected depth. It provides critical ground-truth data for calibrating petrophysical logs and characterizing the heterogeneous facies, diagenetic features, and complex pore systems of Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs."
spherulitic carbonate,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'carbonate rock' formed by abiotic precipitation, which fits the definition of a rock constituted by a collection of sedimentary particles.","A spherulitic carbonate is a non-skeletal carbonate rock that is characterized by a fabric of coalesced, radially fibrous spherulites precipitated abiotically from alkaline lacustrine waters. This depositional texture commonly preserves significant primary inter-spherulite porosity. Consequently, these facies constitute some of the most important and prolific reservoir intervals in the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
strain,quality,"The NLD defines strain as a measure of deformation (change in shape, size, or orientation) of a rock body, which is a property that inheres in that body, fitting the BFO definition of a quality.","Strain is a dimensionless measure of deformation that quantifies the change in shape, size, or orientation of a rock body in response to applied stress. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, it encompasses the brittle fracturing and faulting of carbonate reservoirs as well as the ductile flow of the Aptian salt layer. These deformation processes are critical in shaping the structural traps and influencing reservoir quality."

In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this condition results from the superposition of rift-related faulting and intense halokinesis. This complexity governs trap definition, reservoir compartmentalization, and the overall uncertainty in subsurface characterization."
syn-rift stage,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD defines the term as a 'tectono-stratigraphic phase of basin evolution,' which is a specific period of time characterized by certain geological processes.","The syn-rift stage is a tectono-stratigraphic phase of basin evolution that is characterized by active continental extension and concurrent normal faulting. This tectonic activity creates the accommodation space that governs the deposition and architecture of key petroleum system elements. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this stage is defined by the accumulation of lacustrine source rocks and coquina-microbialite reservoirs within fault-bounded grabens."
time-depth conversion,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'fundamental geophysical process that transforms seismic data', which aligns with the definition of a process that modifies the representation of geological objects.","Time-depth conversion is a fundamental geophysical process that transforms seismic data recorded in two-way travel time into a geologically representative depth model.

This unit provides the fundamental heat flow that drives the maturation of the petroleum system's source rocks.
basement topography,Geometry,"The NLD defines the term as the 'geomorphological expression' and 'inherited relief' of a surface, which aligns with the definition of Geometry as a quality related to an object's external three-dimensional shape.","Basement topography is the geomorphological expression of the pre-rift crystalline basement surface that was shaped by extensional tectonics and erosion during the continental rifting phase. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this inherited relief provided the primary control on accommodation space for the overlying sag basin. It thereby dictated the distribution, geometry, and facies architecture of the microbial carbonate reservoirs, which preferentially developed on structural paleo-highs."
calcite crystal shrub,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD defines the term as an 'aggregate of calcite crystals,' which is a type of rock constituted by a collection of sedimentary particles.","A calcite crystal shrub is a primary carbonate precipitate that forms a dendritic, branching aggregate of calcite crystals.

Its geometry is primarily controlled by the interplay between accommodation space, created by subsidence and lake-level fluctuations, and the type and rate of carbonate sediment production. This framework is critical for predicting the distribution of reservoir facies, such as coquinas and microbialites, within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system."
early cementation,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'diagenetic process that precipitates carbonate minerals,' which aligns with the definition of a Geological Process that modifies the composition of geological materials.","Early cementation is a diagenetic process that precipitates carbonate minerals within sediment pore spaces at or near the depositional surface, prior to significant burial. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is fundamental for creating a rigid framework in microbialites and coquinas, which preserves primary porosity by resisting mechanical compaction. The timing and nature of this cementation, whether microbially mediated, marine, or meteoric, are primary controls on the ultimate reservoir quality."

This classification directly links observed rock characteristics, such as spherulitic or shrub-like fabrics, to key reservoir parameters like porosity and permeability."
marine system,Depositional System,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'depositional system' that controls the distribution and character of sedimentary facies.,"A marine system is a depositional system that is governed by the physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring within a saline water body, which control the distribution and character of sedimentary facies. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this system encompasses the stratified, often hypersaline, depositional environment responsible for the generation of both organic-rich source rocks and coeval microbial-to-abiotic carbonate reservoirs. The evolution of this system's water chemistry and energy regime directly dictates the architecture and petrophysical properties of the reservoir facies."

It is the primary tool for analyzing reservoir performance and forecasting estimated ultimate recovery (EUR), providing critical insights into drainage dynamics, pressure support effectiveness, and water breakthrough in the high-productivity carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. The characteristic shape of the curve, including its initial ramp-up, plateau, and decline phases, is fundamental for optimizing reservoir management strategies."
rift shoulder,Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as a 'high-standing tectonic block,' which is a rigid entity with its own identity and unity, generated by a geological process (rifting).","A rift shoulder is a high-standing tectonic block that forms the elevated flank of a continental rift valley on the upthrown side of a major, basin-bounding normal fault. During the Early Cretaceous rifting of the South Atlantic, these shoulders formed prominent highlands that underwent significant erosion. Consequently, they acted as the primary provenance area for siliciclastic sediments transported into the sag basin, directly influencing the depositional architecture and reservoir quality of the Brazilian Pre-Salt section."

It is predominantly composed of lacustrine deposits, which include the system's primary source rocks and the prolific microbial carbonate reservoirs. This succession lies above the initial rift clastics and volcanics and is capped by the pre-Aptian unconformity beneath the evaporite sequence."
wedge geometry,Wedge Geometry,"The NLD defines the term as a specific 'geometry' and 'stratigraphic architecture' with a wedge shape, which directly corresponds to the 'Wedge Geometry' category, a specific value for the quality of Geometry.","A wedge geometry is a stratigraphic architecture that results from differential subsidence during syn-rift deposition, characterized by a systematic thickening of strata towards a controlling fault. This geometry is a primary seismic-stratigraphic indicator of syn-tectonic sedimentation within half-grabens. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it governs the distribution and thickness of key carbonate reservoir facies, such as coquinas and microbialites."
aggradational carbonate platform,Depositional Unit,"The NLD describes a large-scale 'geobody' composed of sedimentary rock ('carbonates') formed by 'sediment accumulation', which fits the definition of a mappable Sedimentary Geological Object.","An aggradational carbonate platform is a lacustrine carbonate platform that is characterized by a predominantly vertical stacking of facies, formed when the rate of sediment accumulation keeps pace with the rate of accommodation creation during tectonic subsidence. Composed primarily of microbial and spherulitic carbonates, these geobodies constitute the main reservoir intervals of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
carbonate shale,Sedimentary Rock,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'source rock' that is 'composed of a mixture of laminated carbonate minerals and kerogen,' which directly aligns with the definition of a rock constituted by sedimentary particles.","A carbonate shale is a fine-grained, organic-rich source rock that is composed of a mixture of laminated carbonate minerals and kerogen, deposited in the anoxic lacustrine systems characteristic of the Brazilian Pre-Salt sag phase. In this petroleum system, it is distinguished from a marl by its higher organic content and its primary function as a hydrocarbon source rather than a seal or reservoir. These rocks represent the principal generating interval for the giant oil and gas accumulations found in the overlying microbialite reservoirs."
clastic sediment,Sediment,"The NLD defines the term as an 'accumulation of unconsolidated particles', which directly aligns with the definition of Sediment as an Unconsolidated Earth Material.","A clastic sediment is an accumulation of unconsolidated particles that is composed of fragments, or clasts, derived from the physical weathering and erosion of pre-existing rocks. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine systems, these sediments are typically sourced from the erosion of crystalline basement and volcanic rocks of the rift margins. Their deposition as discrete sandstone bodies or mixture with carbonate facies represents a critical control on reservoir heterogeneity."
coquina bank,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines it as a 'carbonate buildup' and 'distinct topographic feature' formed by a 'depositional process' of shell fragments, which is consistent with the definition of a depositional unit.","A coquina bank is a bioclastic carbonate buildup that is composed of coarse, mechanically sorted lacustrine shell fragments accumulated by wave action into a distinct topographic feature. This depositional process results in a rock fabric with high primary interparticle porosity and permeability. Consequently, coquina banks constitute some of the most prolific reservoir facies within the lacustrine carbonate succession of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
coquina deposit,Depositional Unit,"The NLD describes a body of sedimentary rock ('deposit') that constitutes reservoir intervals, fitting the definition of a recognizable sedimentary geological object.","A coquina deposit is a grain-supported bioclastic carbonate rock that is predominantly composed of whole or fragmented shells of lacustrine bivalves and gastropods. It typically forms in shallow, high-energy settings along the margins of saline lakes, where wave action reworks and concentrates the bioclasts. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these deposits constitute highly porous and permeable reservoir intervals due to their exceptional primary interparticle porosity and subsequent diagenetic enhancement."
debris flow,Geological Process,"The NLD defines it as a 'sediment gravity flow' that 'transports material', which is a physical process that generates a geological deposit.","A debris flow is a high-density sediment gravity flow that is composed of poorly sorted carbonate clasts supported within a cohesive, fine-grained matrix. Triggered by slope instability, it transports material from carbonate platform margins into deeper lacustrine settings. Its resulting deposit, a debriite, constitutes a significant and often chaotic reservoir facies in the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
geological context,generically dependent continuant,"The NLD defines the term as a 'conceptual framework' that integrates a set of elements and processes, which aligns with the BFO definition of a shareable pattern or content.","A geological context is a conceptual framework that integrates the set of tectonic, stratigraphic, depositional, and diagenetic elements and processes that controlled the formation and evolution of a specific geological feature over time. For the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this framework is fundamentally defined by the Early Cretaceous rifting of the South Atlantic, the development of unique lacustrine carbonate systems in a sag basin, and the subsequent deposition of a thick Aptian evaporitic seal. This context is therefore essential for predicting reservoir presence, quality, and the overall petroleum system effectiveness."
high,Geological Object,"The NLD defines a 'high' as a physical, three-dimensional 'structural and/or paleotopographic feature' with positive relief, which aligns with the definition of a Geological Object as a rigid entity with its own identity created by geological processes.","A high is a structural and/or paleotopographic feature that constitutes an area of positive relief relative to adjacent depocenters. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these features are critical as they control the location and development of carbonate reservoir facies. They frequently form the structural culmination for hydrocarbon traps."
hydrocarbon seal,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as a 'stratigraphic unit' and provides an example of an 'evaporite sequence,' which is a type of sedimentary rock, fitting the definition of a geological object constituted by sedimentary rock.","A hydrocarbon seal is a stratigraphic unit that forms an impermeable or low-permeability barrier above a reservoir, preventing the upward migration and escape of accumulated hydrocarbons. It is characterized by a high capillary entry pressure sufficient to withstand the buoyancy pressure exerted by the trapped fluid column. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this critical function is primarily performed by the thick and ductile Aptian evaporite sequence."
hydrodynamics,Geological Process,"The NLD describes the movement, migration, accumulation, and distribution of subsurface fluids, which are physical processes that modify the arrangement of Earth Materials.","Hydrodynamics is the study of the energy and movement of subsurface fluids, such as oil, gas, and brine, that governs their migration, accumulation, and distribution within a petroleum system. This analysis of pressure regimes and flow patterns is critical for defining fluid contacts and assessing trap integrity in the complex carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. It quantifies the interplay between driving forces, like buoyancy and compaction, and the resistive forces of the basin's plumbing system."
lithostratigraphic unit,Depositional Unit,"The NLD defines the term as a 'mappable body of rock strata', which directly corresponds to the definition of a Depositional Unit as a Sedimentary Geological Object recognizable at a mapping scale.","A lithostratigraphic unit is a mappable body of rock strata that is defined and recognized based on its distinct lithological characteristics and its stratigraphic position relative to other units. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these units are characterized by specific successions of carbonate facies, such as the microbialites and coquinas of the Barra Velha Formation. The delineation of these bodies using seismic and well log data is fundamental for correlating and modeling reservoir, seal, and source rock intervals."
marine evaporite,Sedimentary Rock,The definition explicitly states that a marine evaporite is a 'chemical sedimentary rock' formed by the precipitation of dissolved mineral salts.,"A marine evaporite is a chemical sedimentary rock that is formed by the precipitation of dissolved mineral salts, such as halite and anhydrite, from the intense evaporation of a restricted body of seawater. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these deposits constitute the Aptian salt layer, a thick and ductile succession that acts as the primary regional seal for the underlying carbonate reservoir systems. This salt layer's unique geomechanical properties also control the post-salt structural deformation and heat flow within the basin."
neoaptian,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD defines the term as a 'chronostratigraphic sub-stage' and a part of the 'Aptian Age,' which is a temporal region within geological time.","The Neoaptian is a chronostratigraphic sub-stage that encompasses the final part of the Aptian Age and is characterized in the Brazilian Pre-Salt by the deposition of the main lacustrine carbonate reservoir succession. This succession, primarily composed of the microbialites and spherulites of the Barra Velha Formation, represents the terminal sag phase of the South Atlantic rift system. It is immediately overlain by the Aptian evaporites that constitute the regional seal for this prolific petroleum system."
offshore basin,Depositional System,"The NLD describes the basin as containing a 'sedimentary succession' and hosting 'petroleum systems', which fits the definition of an aggregate of linked depositional units.","An offshore basin is a sedimentary basin that is situated on the continental margin seaward of the present-day coastline, whose formation is typically associated with continental rifting. Its sedimentary succession records the complete tectonic evolution from rift to passive margin, hosting significant petroleum systems like the Brazilian Pre-Salt. These systems are characterized by lacustrine source rocks charging vast microbial carbonate reservoirs deposited during the post-rift sag phase."
plateau,Depositional Unit,"The NLD describes a plateau as a 'large-scale depositional geobody,' which fits the definition of a Sedimentary Geological Object recognizable at a mapping scale.","A plateau is a large-scale depositional geobody within a lacustrine carbonate buildup that is characterized by a broad, relatively flat-topped morphology formed by the aggradation of in-situ microbial and bioclastic facies on a paleotopographic high. This feature typically develops during the sag phase of rift evolution, where balanced rates of subsidence and carbonate production allow for extensive vertical and lateral growth. It represents a primary reservoir target in the Brazilian Pre-Salt due to its often high-quality porous and permeable intervals."
progradational carbonate platform,Depositional System,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'carbonate depositional system', which is an aggregate of linked depositional units.","A progradational carbonate platform is a carbonate depositional system that is characterized by a dominant lateral, basinward growth pattern created by sedimentary offlap. This geometry results from periods where the rate of carbonate sediment production and accumulation at the platform margin exceeds the rate of accommodation space creation. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine successions, these platforms are typically composed of microbial and abiotic carbonates, forming clinoforms that constitute significant hydrocarbon reservoirs."
shell,Sedimentary Rock,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'bioclastic carbonate rock' which is constituted by a collection of sedimentary particles (carapaces).,"A shell is a bioclastic carbonate rock that is predominantly composed of whole or fragmented bivalve and gastropod carapaces. This grain-supported facies constitutes a primary reservoir target in the Brazilian Pre-Salt, having been deposited in high-energy, shallow lacustrine environments. It is characterized by high original interparticle and intraparticle porosity, which is often enhanced by diagenesis."
siliciclastic deposit,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines the term as a 'sedimentary body' composed of sedimentary material (fragments of silicate minerals), which directly aligns with the definition of a Sedimentary Geological Object.","A siliciclastic deposit is a sedimentary body that is composed predominantly of terrigenous fragments of silicate minerals, such as quartz, feldspar, and clays, derived from the weathering and erosion of pre-existing rocks. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, these deposits form critical sandstone reservoirs or shale source and seal rocks, often interbedded with the main lacustrine carbonate successions."
tectonic history,Geological Process,"The NLD defines the term as a 'chronological framework of deformational processes' and lists specific examples of these processes, such as the Gondwana break-up and thermal sag.","Tectonic history is a chronological framework of deformational processes that dictates the structural evolution of a basin and controls the primary elements of its petroleum system. For the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this history is defined by the Gondwana break-up, which generated the rift architecture hosting lacustrine source rocks and carbonate reservoirs. The subsequent post-rift thermal sag and intense halokinesis were fundamental for source rock maturation, salt seal deposition, and the final configuration of structural-stratigraphic traps."
thermal anomaly,fiat object part,"The NLD defines this as a 'subsurface region' whose boundaries are not physical discontinuities but are determined by a deviation in a thermal property, which corresponds to a part of a material entity demarcated by fiat surfaces.","A thermal anomaly is a subsurface region that exhibits a significant deviation from the regional geothermal gradient, primarily caused by post-rift magmatic intrusions or the heat-focusing effect of salt structures. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, these anomalies exert a first-order control on the maturation of source rocks, the timing of hydrocarbon generation, and the final fluid phase within the carbonate reservoirs."
volcanic source area,Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as a 'paleogeographic provenance area' and an 'exposed landmass,' which corresponds to a large-scale, identifiable geological body with its own unity criteria.","A volcanic source area is a paleogeographic provenance area, typically a rift-related structural high, that is composed of volcanic rocks. This exposed landmass supplied volcaniclastic and siliciclastic detritus through weathering and erosion into the adjacent lacustrine depositional systems of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. The resulting sediment influx directly influences the lithological composition and reservoir quality of the coeval carbonate successions."
continental environment,Depositional System,"The NLD defines the term as a 'depositional setting' represented by 'fluvial-lacustrine systems', which are aggregates of linked depositional units.","A continental environment is a depositional setting that is situated on a landmass above sea level and is dominated by non-marine sedimentary processes. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this setting is represented by the syn-rift fluvial-lacustrine systems that developed within an arid intracontinental rift valley. These lacustrine systems were responsible for the deposition of the organic-rich shales that constitute the primary source rocks of the petroleum system."
eoaptian,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geologic sub-age' and an 'interval' of time, which directly aligns with the definition of a Geological Time Interval.","The Eoaptian is a geologic sub-age of the Lower Cretaceous that is characterized by the deposition of the prolific lacustrine source rocks which immediately predate the regional Aptian salt seal in the Brazilian Pre-Salt succession. This interval represents the final stage of the rift phase, where a stratified water column promoted the preservation of organic matter in shales and coquinas. These rocks constitute the fundamental charging element for the entire Pre-Salt petroleum system."
growth fault,Geological Structure,"The NLD defines the term as a 'syn-sedimentary normal fault,' and 'fault' is a canonical example of a Geological Structure which describes the arrangement of geological objects.","A growth fault is a syn-sedimentary normal fault that experiences displacement contemporaneously with sediment deposition. This syn-kinematic activity results in a progressive thickening of stratigraphic units into the downthrown hanging wall block. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is fundamental to creating the accommodation space required for the development of the sag-phase carbonate reservoirs."
ocean opening,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geodynamic process' that creates and modifies geological objects like ocean basins.,"An ocean opening is a geodynamic process that comprises the progressive stages of continental rifting and subsequent seafloor spreading, which creates a new ocean basin. In the South Atlantic, this process established the fundamental tectono-stratigraphic framework that controlled the deposition of the Pre-Salt lacustrine source rocks and carbonate reservoirs. The thermal maturation of this petroleum system is directly linked to the post-rift subsidence and heat flow of the newly formed passive margin."
producing field,object aggregate,"The NLD defines a producing field as an entity encompassing a collection of multiple distinct objects (reservoirs, fluids, infrastructure) that together form a functional unit.","A producing field is a defined geographical area that is underlain by one or more petroleum reservoirs from which hydrocarbons are being commercially and continuously extracted via installed production facilities. This entity encompasses the reservoir rock, the contained fluids, and the surface and subsurface infrastructure required for ongoing extraction, processing, and transport. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these are typically giant deepwater fields hosted in complex carbonate reservoirs that are developed through high-capacity subsea wells tied back to floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) units."
rift process,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a large-scale tectonic process that generates and modifies geological objects, which directly aligns with the definition of a Geological Process.","A rift process is a large-scale tectonic process that involves the stretching and thinning of the continental lithosphere in response to extensional forces. This process generates elongated basins bounded by normal faults, creating the characteristic horst-and-graben structural framework. In the context of the Brazilian margin, this event during the Early Cretaceous breakup of Gondwana created the accommodation space for the deposition of the lacustrine source rocks and microbial carbonate reservoirs of the Pre-Salt petroleum system."
siliciclastic sediment,Sediment,"The NLD defines the term as a 'class of sediment' composed of mineral fragments, which aligns with the definition of Sediment as an Unconsolidated Earth Material.","A siliciclastic sediment is a class of sediment that is composed predominantly of silicate mineral fragments derived from the weathering and erosion of pre-existing terrigenous rocks. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, these sediments are sourced from the continental landmass and transported into the lacustrine sag basin. Their deposition can form distinct reservoir bodies or mix with coeval carbonate facies, commonly degrading overall reservoir quality."
structural control,Geological Structure,"The NLD describes a condition where a tectonic framework dictates the spatial distribution and geometry of geological elements, which fits the definition of a Geological Structure as the internal arrangement and mutual relationships of a Geological Object's parts.","Structural control is a geological condition wherein the tectonic framework dictates the spatial distribution, geometry, and quality of petroleum system elements. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this is primarily manifested by the rift-related horst and graben system which dictates the location of lacustrine source rocks, the development of carbonate reservoirs on paleo-highs, and the formation of structural traps. This framework also governs the principal migration pathways and the integrity of the overlying evaporitic seal."
sylvinite,Sedimentary Rock,The NLD explicitly defines the term as an 'evaporite rock that is composed primarily of an aggregate of the minerals sylvite (KCl) and halite (NaCl)'.,"Sylvinite is a potash-bearing evaporite rock that is composed primarily of an aggregate of the minerals sylvite (KCl) and halite (NaCl). Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, it occurs as mechanically weak layers within the Aptian salt succession, acting as a ductile detachment surface that influences salt tectonics and the structural configuration of the overlying and underlying strata. Its high solubility and distinct rheology also represent a significant geomechanical consideration for wellbore stability during drilling operations."
wavelet,generically dependent continuant,"The NLD describes a wavelet as a 'seismic waveform' and 'basic building block', which is an abstract pattern or content that can be instantiated, fitting the definition of a generically dependent continuant.","A wavelet is a time-limited seismic waveform that represents the basic building block of a seismic trace recorded from the subsurface. This waveform is convolved with the Earth's reflectivity series, and its characteristics are fundamental for resolving the complex facies of Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs. Accurate wavelet estimation is essential to deconvolve its effects and perform reliable seismic inversion beneath the salt canopy."
benthic microbial community,object aggregate,"The NLD defines the term as an 'assemblage of microorganisms,' which is a material entity consisting of a plurality of objects (the microorganisms) that form a collective unit.","A benthic microbial community is an assemblage of microorganisms that colonizes the substrate at the sediment-water interface of a depositional environment. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine system, these communities are the primary carbonate factory, whose metabolic processes induce the precipitation of minerals that construct the microbialite frameworks of the main reservoir facies."
bioclastic deposit,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines the term as a 'sedimentary deposit' constituted by accumulated skeletal fragments, which fits the definition of a geological object composed of sediment.","A bioclastic deposit is a carbonate sedimentary deposit that is constituted primarily by transported and accumulated skeletal fragments of organisms adapted to saline and alkaline lacustrine environments. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these deposits are typically composed of bivalve and gastropod shells, and reworked microbialite fragments, forming coquinas in high-energy shoal settings. These facies represent the most significant reservoir intervals due to their high primary interparticle porosity and susceptibility to diagenetic enhancement."
calcrete,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD describes calcrete as a physical feature ('crust') constituted by an accumulation of calcium carbonate, which is a sedimentary material, fitting the definition of a geological object made of sedimentary rock.","A calcrete is a paleosol that is characterized by the accumulation of calcium carbonate, forming a crust on subaerially exposed surfaces. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, it develops on top of lacustrine carbonate successions during periods of significant lake-level fall. These features represent key stratigraphic markers for correlation and often act as vertical permeability barriers, contributing to reservoir compartmentalization."
celestine,Earth Material,"The NLD describes celestine as a 'strontium sulfate mineral' that precipitates as a cement, which fits the definition of a natural amount of solid matter generated by a geological process.",Celestine is a strontium sulfate mineral that originates from the Aptian evaporitic succession in the Brazilian Pre-Salt. It commonly precipitates as a late diagenetic cement within the underlying carbonate reservoirs. This cementation significantly reduces reservoir quality by occluding pore space and throats.
clastic,Sedimentary Facies,"The NLD defines 'clastic' as a texture of a sedimentary rock based on the arrangement of fragments, which is a primary sedimentological characteristic used to define a Sedimentary Facies.","Clastic is a texture of a sedimentary rock that is defined by an accumulation of discrete fragments, or clasts, derived from pre-existing materials. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these clasts include both terrigenous siliciclastics and reworked intrabasinal carbonates, such as the bivalve shells that constitute high-porosity coquina reservoirs. This texture is a fundamental attribute for reservoir characterization, as the arrangement and nature of the clasts directly govern storage capacity and fluid flow."

This interval is bounded at its base by a transgressive surface and culminates at a maximum flooding surface. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is often represented by fine-grained siliciclastic or argillaceous carbonate deposits that overlie and vertically seal high-energy carbonate reservoir facies."
group,Depositional System,"The NLD defines a group as a 'succession of two or more genetically related and contiguous formations,' which fits the definition of a Depositional System as an aggregate of linked depositional units.","A group is a fundamental lithostratigraphic unit that consists of a succession of two or more genetically related and contiguous formations. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it typically represents a major tectono-sedimentary cycle, such as the sag phase lacustrine carbonate succession of the Guaratiba Group. This stratigraphic rank is critical as it often encompasses the primary reservoir, source, and seal rock intervals of the petroleum system."
lithologic type,Sedimentary Facies,"The NLD defines it as a rock class based on an assemblage of physical attributes like composition and texture, which is consistent with the definition of a sedimentary facies.","A lithologic type is a fundamental rock class that is defined by a distinct assemblage of physical attributes, including mineralogical composition, grain types, depositional texture, and fabric. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these types, such as spherulitic limestones or coquinas, are distinguished by their specific microbial or bioclastic components and significant diagenetic overprints. Their identification is critical for mapping reservoir facies and predicting petrophysical properties."
lithospheric extension,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'tectonic process' that involves the stretching and thinning of geological objects like the Earth's crust and upper mantle.,"Lithospheric extension is a tectonic process that involves the stretching and thinning of the Earth's crust and upper mantle in response to tensional forces. This process drove the continental rifting that formed the South Atlantic marginal basins, creating the fundamental accommodation space for the deposition of the Pre-Salt lacustrine source and reservoir rocks. The resultant crustal thinning and associated normal faulting established the high geothermal gradients and structural highs critical for the maturation of source rocks and the accumulation of hydrocarbons in the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
mg-silicate,Earth Material,"The NLD defines mg-silicate as an authigenic mineral phase that precipitates, which fits the definition of Earth Material as a natural amount of matter generated by a geological process.","An mg-silicate is an authigenic mineral phase, typically stevensite or kerolite, that precipitates from magnesium- and silica-rich alkaline lake waters within Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs. This precipitation commonly occurs as grain coatings or pore-filling cements within microbialite facies. The presence and texture of these silicates exert a fundamental control on reservoir quality."
mineral composition,quality,"The NLD defines the term as a 'fundamental property' of a geological material, which directly aligns with the BFO definition of a quality that inheres in an independent continuant.","Mineral composition is a fundamental property of a geological material that specifies the identity and relative abundance of its constituent mineral phases. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, this property is a primary control on reservoir quality, as the ratio of calcite to dolomite and the presence of authigenic clays or evaporites directly govern diagenetic pathways, geomechanical behavior, and ultimate petrophysical characteristics. This specification is critical for predicting reservoir performance and building accurate geological models."
mud intraclast,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as a 'sedimentary clast composed of carbonate mud,' which fits the definition of a geological object constituted by sedimentary material.","A mud intraclast is a sedimentary clast composed of carbonate mud that originates from the syn-depositional erosion of semi-lithified sediment within the same depositional basin.

Its evolution is dominated by long-term thermal subsidence, which provides the accommodation space for thick sedimentary successions, including the source, reservoir, and seal elements of major petroleum systems like the Brazilian Pre-Salt. This stable tectonic setting is crucial for the preservation and maturation of hydrocarbons."
pseudomatrix,Sediment,"The NLD describes it as a material resulting from the in-situ crushing and disintegration of fragile grains (bivalve shells), which fits the definition of an unconsolidated earth material constituted by sedimentary particles.","Pseudomatrix is a carbonate matrix-like component that results from the in-situ mechanical crushing and disintegration of fragile framework grains. In Brazilian Pre-Salt coquinas, this material is typically derived from the collapse of bivalve shells, filling the primary interparticle pore space. Its development is a critical process that reduces original porosity and fundamentally alters the final reservoir quality."

This lithology constitutes a key sealing element that compartmentalizes the associated carbonate reservoirs, controlling fluid flow and reservoir connectivity."
viscous medium,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as an 'evaporitic succession that is composed predominantly of halite,' which is a geological body constituted by sedimentary rock.","A viscous medium is an evaporitic succession that is composed predominantly of halite and behaves as a ductile, flowing material over geological time. This rheological property allows it to act as the primary regional seal for the underlying Pre-Salt petroleum systems. Its movement (halokinesis) is a fundamental control on trap formation and the post-salt overburden architecture."

It represents a crucial element of the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, where it controlled the depositional architecture and facies distribution of the overlying sag-phase carbonate reservoirs. This feature significantly influences reservoir quality and hydrocarbon migration pathways."
vugular porosity,Geological Structure,"The NLD describes this as consisting of cavities or vugs, which represents the internal arrangement of voids within a geological object (the rock).","Vugular porosity is a type of secondary porosity that consists of cavities, or vugs, which are significantly larger than the rock's primary fabric elements and are formed by the post-depositional, non-fabric selective dissolution of minerals. In the carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is a dominant pore type created by the dissolution of unstable components such as evaporites, aragonitic spherulites, and bioclasts. The degree of interconnection between these vugs is a primary control on reservoir permeability."
hydrothermal vent complex,Geological Object,"The NLD defines it as a 'geological system' composed of physical parts (conduits, sills, mounds) generated by a geological process, which fits the definition of a Geological Object.","A hydrothermal vent complex is a geological system within the Brazilian Pre-Salt that consists of a network of conduits, sills, and associated surface mounds formed by the focused expulsion of heated, deep-seated fluids during Aptian rifting. It is characterized by intense hydrothermal alteration of the host carbonate reservoirs, leading to the precipitation of distinctive mineral assemblages including quartz, talc, and magnesite. This process creates significant diagenetic heterogeneity, which acts as a primary control on porosity and permeability distribution."

It is the primary control on the storage capacity and fluid-flow properties of a reservoir rock. This framework results from the complex interplay of primary depositional fabrics, such as spherulites and shrubs, and subsequent diagenetic overprints."
porosity formation,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as 'a geological process or set of processes' that creates or enhances void spaces in a rock, which directly matches the definition of a Geological Process.","Porosity formation is a geological process or set of processes that creates or enhances the void spaces within a rock's fabric. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, this primarily includes the dissolution of unstable minerals and matrix, the development of primary depositional voids, and tectonic fracturing. This enhancement of the pore system is critical for creating effective reservoir storage and fluid flow pathways."
post-depositional deformation,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'set of geological processes that modifies the original geometry and fabric of sedimentary rocks'.,"Post-depositional deformation is a set of geological processes that modifies the original geometry and fabric of sedimentary rocks after their initial deposition. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these processes are predominantly driven by halokinesis and regional tectonic stresses, leading to the folding, faulting, and fracturing of the microbial carbonate reservoirs. Such deformation is a critical control on the final geometry of structural traps and the creation or destruction of reservoir porosity and permeability."

In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this succession typically evolves from deeper lacustrine laminated mudstones at the base to high-energy, reservoir-quality facies like spherulitic grainstones or coquinas. The cycle is commonly terminated by a subaerial exposure surface or evaporite deposits, representing the shallowest phase of the depositional system."
travertine system,Depositional System,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'hydrothermal carbonate depositional system', which directly aligns with this category.","A travertine system is a hydrothermal carbonate depositional system that develops in continental rift settings from the subaerial or subaqueous precipitation of calcite or aragonite. This precipitation is driven by the degassing of CO2 from heated, calcium-bicarbonate-rich fluids ascending along major fault zones. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these systems form localized, high-porosity reservoir bodies often associated with volcanic highs."
truncated reflector,Sedimentary Structure,"The NLD defines this as a 'geometric pattern' where strata are 'abruptly cut off', which fits the definition of a Sedimentary Structure as a pattern of the internal arrangement of Depositional Units.","A truncated reflector is a seismic reflection termination that represents a stratum, or a set of strata, being abruptly cut off by an overlying unconformity. This geometric pattern is a primary criterion for identifying sequence boundaries and potential stratigraphic traps within the Pre-Salt carbonate successions. Such truncations are critical for mapping the extent of reservoir facies below major erosional surfaces like the Aptian unconformity."

It serves as a key lithology indicator used to distinguish high-radioactivity shales and marls from the characteristically low-radioactivity carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. This differentiation is critical for mapping reservoir bodies, such as microbialites and coquinas, and identifying potential sealing layers within the sag and rift sequences."

The primary objective is to gather raw data used to create detailed images of geological structures and stratigraphy. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this involves advanced marine survey designs, such as Ocean Bottom Node (OBN), specifically aimed at illuminating complex carbonate reservoir targets beneath thick, rugose salt bodies."
seismic inversion,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geophysical process that transforms seismic reflection data' to characterize reservoirs.,"Seismic inversion is a geophysical process that transforms seismic reflection data into a quantitative volume of rock properties, such as acoustic impedance. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is fundamental for characterizing heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs by predicting porosity distribution and discriminating between microbialite and coquina lithofacies. The resulting property volumes are critical inputs for building static reservoir models and guiding well placement to target high-quality reservoir zones."

alkaline environment,Geological Process,"The NLD describes a geochemical system driven by processes like weathering, evaporation, and precipitation that control the formation of geological objects.","An alkaline environment is a geochemical system that is characterized by a pH greater than 7 and elevated concentrations of bicarbonate and carbonate ions, creating a high buffer capacity. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this lacustrine system was driven by intense continental weathering and evaporation in a restricted rift setting. This environment directly controlled the precipitation of non-skeletal carbonates and the prolific development of microbialite reservoir facies."
biologic activity,Geological Process,The NLD defines the term as a 'set of processes' driven by organisms that are responsible for the formation and modification of geological objects like reservoirs and source rocks.,"Biologic activity is a set of processes that is driven by organisms and directly influences the depositional character and early diagenesis of sedimentary rocks.

This parameter is critical in lacustrine carbonate settings, where it segregates high-energy, grain-supported reservoir facies from low-energy, mud-supported source and seal facies. The resulting rock fabric directly influences the primary porosity and permeability of potential Pre-Salt reservoirs."
early aptian,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD defines the term as a 'geochronologic sub-age of the Cretaceous Period,' which is a specific interval within the Global Geological Time.","The Early Aptian is a geochronologic sub-age of the Cretaceous Period that defines the final rift-to-sag transitional phase in the South Atlantic margin, characterized by the deposition of the prolific lacustrine microbial carbonate reservoirs of the Barra Velha Formation immediately preceding the emplacement of the regional salt seal."

In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this property is the primary control on the depositional fabric of lacustrine carbonates. It directly governs the formation of high-porosity reservoir facies, such as coquinas and microbialites, versus low-porosity, muddy facies."

This process is a critical control on reservoir quality, driving the widespread dolomitization and silicification of the carbonate successions."
low frequency,Facies,"The NLD describes this term as a component of a model representing large-scale geological trends, which aligns with the definition of a Facies as a pattern of properties of Geological Objects.","Low frequency is a component of a subsurface model that represents the large-scale geological trends absent from the recorded seismic signal's bandwidth.

In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this succession is positioned stratigraphically below the regional Aptian salt seal. It contains the primary lacustrine source rocks and the prolific carbonate reservoirs that constitute the Pre-Salt petroleum system."
non-reservoir facies,Sedimentary Facies,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'sedimentary facies' characterized by specific sedimentological properties, namely the lack of effective porosity and permeability.","A non-reservoir facies is a sedimentary facies that, due to its primary depositional characteristics or subsequent diagenetic alteration, lacks the effective porosity and permeability required to store or transmit hydrocarbons in commercially viable quantities. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these include rock types such as dense, heavily cemented microbialites, argillaceous carbonates, and evaporitic layers. Such facies commonly function as seals or baffles, creating barriers to fluid flow and contributing to reservoir compartmentalization."
oil equivalent,quality,"The NLD defines this term as a metric or a standardized value representing the energy content of hydrocarbons, which is a quality that inheres in that material.","Oil equivalent is a metric that standardizes the quantity of various hydrocarbon types, primarily natural gas and condensates, into a single value based on the energy content of crude oil. This normalization allows for the consistent aggregation of reserves, resources, and production volumes from reservoirs containing multiple fluid phases, such as those found in the Brazilian Pre-Salt. The conversion is performed using a factor that equates the energy released upon combustion of a given volume of gas or condensate to that of a barrel of oil."
oil production,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'process' involving the extraction and transfer of fluids from a subsurface reservoir, which modifies a geological object.","Oil production is the hydrocarbon recovery process that involves the extraction of crude oil and associated fluids from a subsurface reservoir and their transfer to surface processing facilities. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is characterized by lifting fluids from deepwater carbonate reservoirs through complex subsea systems to a floating production unit.

Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt sag phase, this setting is critical for the development of thick, high-quality microbialite and coquina lacustrine carbonate reservoirs."
stratigraphic surface,Geological Boundary,"The NLD defines the term as a 'boundary that separates adjacent strata', which directly corresponds to the definition of a Geological Boundary as a physical discontinuity on the external surface of a Geological Object.","A stratigraphic surface is a chronostratigraphically significant boundary that separates adjacent strata. It represents a specific interval of geologic time characterized by a change in depositional conditions, non-deposition, or erosion. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine carbonate successions, these surfaces are fundamental for defining reservoir architecture and often correspond to distinct seismic reflectors that delineate key sequence stratigraphic packages."
subaerial exposure feature,Sedimentary Structure,"The NLD describes this as a feature, such as karst networks and caves, which represents a pattern of internal arrangement within a carbonate succession (a type of Depositional Unit).","A subaerial exposure feature is a geological feature that is produced by a combination of diagenetic, erosional, and pedogenic processes when carbonate successions are exposed to atmospheric conditions. This exposure, typically driven by a relative sea-level fall, creates significant secondary porosity and marks a key stratigraphic surface such as a sequence boundary. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these features manifest as extensive karst networks, including vugs and collapsed caves, which form the highest quality reservoir intervals."

Its high reactivity and potential for dissolution during CO₂ injection make it a critical mineral for understanding diagenetic evolution and predicting reservoir behavior."
diagenetic constituent,Earth Material,"The NLD describes it as a material element (cements, minerals) formed by post-depositional geological processes, which aligns with the definition of Earth Material as a natural amount of matter generated by a Geological Process.","A diagenetic constituent is a rock fabric element that is formed in situ through post-depositional processes, altering the primary depositional texture. It typically includes cements that precipitate in pore spaces, minerals that replace pre-existing grains or matrix, and products of recrystallization. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, common diagenetic constituents such as calcite cements, authigenic clays, and replacement dolomite fundamentally control the evolution of porosity and permeability, thereby defining reservoir quality."
diagenetic evolution,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'temporal succession of physical, chemical, and biological processes' that modifies a sedimentary rock, which is the definition of a Geological Process.","Diagenetic evolution is the temporal succession of physical, chemical, and biological processes that modifies a sedimentary rock's primary fabric, mineralogy, and petrophysical properties. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, this succession involves complex interactions of dissolution, cementation, and replacement that overprint the original microbial and spherulitic carbonate fabrics. The specific pathway of these events is the primary control on the final distribution of reservoir porosity and permeability."
gravitational redeposition,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'sedimentary mass transport process' that remobilizes and transports sediments, which aligns with the definition of a Geological Process.","Gravitational redeposition is a sedimentary mass transport process that remobilizes and transports previously deposited sediments downslope under the primary influence of gravity. In the lacustrine carbonate systems of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is fundamental to the formation of prolific reservoirs by transporting coquina and microbialite fragments from structural highs into adjacent depositional lows. These resulting debris flows and turbidites often constitute the most porous and permeable reservoir facies."
growth-framework porosity,site,"The NLD defines the term as 'the original void space preserved between the rigid, in-situ components,' which aligns with the BFO definition of a site as a three-dimensional immaterial entity whose boundaries are determined by material entities.","Growth-framework porosity is a type of primary macroporosity that represents the original void space preserved between the rigid, in-situ components of a carbonate framework. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, this porosity is typically generated by the complex arrangement of microbialites, shrubs, and spherulites that constitute the reservoir rock. It constitutes a critical pore type for fluid storage and flow, often forming cavernous to vuggy networks with high permeability."
humid climate,Geological Process,"The NLD describes it as a condition that actively drives geological changes, such as freshwater influx and water column stratification, which are processes that lead to reservoir and source rock formation.","A humid climate is a paleoclimatic condition that is characterized by high precipitation, driving significant freshwater and nutrient influx into a depositional basin such as the Pre-Salt lacustrine sag basins. This influx induces a stable chemical stratification of the water column. Such stratification is critical for simultaneously developing prolific carbonate reservoirs in the upper oxic layer and preserving organic matter for source rock formation in the lower anoxic layer."
macrocrystalline calcite,Earth Material,"The NLD defines it as a 'diagenetic carbonate mineral' and a 'mineral phase', which fits the definition of Earth Material as a natural amount of matter generated by a geological process.","Macrocrystalline calcite is a diagenetic carbonate mineral that is characterized by coarse, interlocking crystals which precipitate as a late-stage cement within the lacustrine reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. This mineral phase typically occludes primary interparticle porosity and secondary vuggy or fracture porosity, exerting a primary control on reservoir quality. Its precipitation is often associated with burial diagenesis and the circulation of magnesium-depleted fluids, significantly altering the original rock fabric."
macrocrystalline quartz,Earth Material,"The NLD describes macrocrystalline quartz as a variety of mineral and a diagenetic phase that acts as cement, which aligns with the definition of Earth Material as a natural amount of matter generated by a geological process.","Macrocrystalline quartz is a variety of the mineral quartz that is characterized by individual crystals large enough to be discerned by the naked eye. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, it primarily occurs as a late-stage authigenic phase that replaces precursor carbonate grains and evaporite minerals or precipitates as a cement within interparticle and vuggy porosity. The development of this diagenetic quartz is a critical control on reservoir quality, as its precipitation typically occludes the pore network and significantly reduces permeability."
oil province,Depositional System,"The NLD describes a collection of petroleum accumulations that are genetically linked by a common geological history, which fits the definition of an object aggregate of linked depositional units.",An oil province is a geographic region that contains a significant volume of petroleum accumulations which are genetically linked by a common geological history and one or more related petroleum systems.
wavy lamination,Sedimentary Structure,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'primary sedimentary structure' which describes a pattern of internal arrangement.,"Wavy lamination is a primary sedimentary structure that is defined by a series of conformable, sub-centimeter scale laminae exhibiting a continuous, undulating geometry. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this fabric is a key indicator of depositional environments influenced by microbial mat growth or the gentle reworking of fine-grained carbonates by low-energy currents. Its characterization is critical for understanding reservoir heterogeneity in lacustrine carbonate systems."
relay ramp,Geological Structure,"The NLD defines a relay ramp as a 'structural bridge of tilted strata' and a 'structure' that forms through deformation, which aligns with the definition of a Geological Structure as the configuration and arrangement of parts of a Geological Object.","A relay ramp is a structural bridge of tilted strata that transfers displacement between two overlapping, en-echelon normal faults. This structure forms in the step-over zone through the ductile deformation of the intervening rock volume. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, the integrity and fracture intensity of these ramps critically control the connectivity and compartmentalization of lacustrine carbonate reservoirs."
reservoir management,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'continuous and integrated multidisciplinary process' that modifies a geological object (the reservoir) to optimize hydrocarbon recovery.,"Reservoir management is a continuous and integrated multidisciplinary process that applies geoscience, engineering, and economic principles to optimize hydrocarbon recovery and maximize the economic value of a petroleum reservoir throughout its lifecycle. This process relies on the integration of static and dynamic data to build predictive models that honor the geological complexity of the reservoir system. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it specifically guides strategic decisions on well placement and advanced recovery methods, such as CO2-WAG injection, to effectively drain the highly heterogeneous microbial carbonate reservoirs."
closed lake,Depositional System,The NLD explicitly defines a closed lake as a 'lacustrine depositional system' where various depositional units like source rocks and carbonates are formed.,"A closed lake is a lacustrine depositional system that lacks significant outflow, where water loss is dominated by evaporation. This process concentrates dissolved solids, creating a stratified, alkaline, and often hypersaline water column essential for the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system. This endorheic setting promotes the coeval deposition of organic-rich source rocks in anoxic bottom waters and the precipitation of microbial carbonates that form the primary reservoirs."
normal grading,Sedimentary Structure,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'primary sedimentary structure' characterized by the internal arrangement of particles within a depositional bed.,"Normal grading is a primary sedimentary structure that is characterized by a progressive upward decrease in the mean size of constituent particles, such as spherulites or bioclasts, within a single depositional bed. This texture typically results from deposition during a single, waning-energy event, such as a storm-induced flow or a gravity-driven current common in the lacustrine Pre-Salt setting. The resulting vertical heterogeneity in grain size directly influences reservoir quality by creating variations in porosity and permeability."
petrophysical characteristic,quality,"The NLD defines the term as a 'quantifiable physical property of a rock formation' (e.g., porosity, permeability), which corresponds to the BFO definition of a quality that inheres in an independent continuant.","A petrophysical characteristic is a quantifiable physical property of a rock formation that governs the storage, flow, and distribution of fluids within its pore system. It is derived from well log data and laboratory core analysis to quantify key reservoir parameters like porosity, permeability, and fluid saturation. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these characteristics are fundamental for distinguishing productive microbialite and coquina facies from non-reservoir rock types."
sedimentary process,Geological Process,"The NLD defines the term as a set of mechanisms that form, transport, and deposit material, which directly aligns with the definition of a Geological Process that generates or modifies geological objects.","A sedimentary process is a set of physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms that governs the formation, transport, and deposition of sedimentary material, thereby controlling the primary architecture and facies distribution of a sedimentary succession. In lacustrine carbonate systems like the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these processes are dominated by in-situ precipitation and biogenic growth, with subsequent reworking by gravity flows and wave action. This ultimately defines the initial reservoir quality and geometry prior to significant diagenetic overprint."
transition zone,Sedimentary Geological Object,"The NLD defines this as a 'reservoir interval' within 'Pre-Salt carbonates', which is a geological object constituted by sedimentary rock.","A transition zone is a reservoir interval that vertically separates the main hydrocarbon column from the underlying aquifer. It is characterized by the co-presence of mobile hydrocarbons and water, where water saturation progressively increases with depth due to capillary forces acting within the complex pore systems of Pre-Salt carbonates. The significant thickness of this zone is a key feature for volumetric calculations in these lacustrine reservoirs."
analogue,generically dependent continuant,"The NLD describes an analogue as a reference feature used to build predictive models, meaning it provides a shareable pattern of attributes (architecture, facies) that can be applied to another system, which fits the definition of a generically dependent continuant.","An analogue is a geological feature or system that shares key depositional and diagenetic attributes with a target Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonate reservoir. This accessible reference, often an outcrop or modern environment, is studied to build predictive models for reservoir architecture, facies distribution, and rock properties. The resulting models are used to reduce subsurface uncertainty and de-risk exploration and development decisions."
detrital component,Earth Material,"The NLD defines the term as a 'rock constituent' composed of an aggregate of matter like grains and fragments, which aligns with the definition of Earth Material as a natural amount of matter.","A detrital component is a rock constituent that is composed of siliciclastic grains or allochthonous carbonate fragments physically transported from an external source area. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine successions, it typically consists of quartz, feldspar, and clay minerals derived from the erosion of the adjacent basement highs. The volume and distribution of this component are critical controls on the petrophysical properties and heterogeneity of the carbonate reservoirs."
fascicular crust,Sedimentary Facies,"The NLD explicitly states that the term constitutes a 'primary reservoir facies' and describes its specific sedimentological characteristics, such as its carbonate fabric and crystal arrangement.","A fascicular crust is an accretionary carbonate fabric that is characterized by divergent, fan-like bundles of calcite crystals, interpreted as a microbially-mediated precipitate. It commonly forms laminated to dendritic build-ups on substrate surfaces within the Aptian lacustrine successions of the South Atlantic rift basins. These crusts constitute a primary reservoir facies in the Brazilian Pre-Salt, where their preserved inter-fascicular porosity creates zones of high permeability."
hydrothermal,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geological process' driven by the circulation of heated fluids that modify crustal rocks.,"A hydrothermal process is a geological process driven by the circulation of heated, chemically reactive aqueous fluids through crustal rocks. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these fluids are typically magnesium-rich, heated by rift-related magmatism, and derive their solutes from the alteration of associated mafic and ultramafic rocks. This process is a primary control on the diagenesis and dolomitization that dictates the quality of the carbonate reservoirs."
water residence time,quality,"The NLD defines this term as a 'parameter that quantifies the average duration', which is a measurable property inhering in the water within a depositional system, fitting the BFO definition of a quality.","Water residence time is a hydrogeological parameter that quantifies the average duration a water molecule remains within a defined depositional system, such as a lacustrine basin. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, prolonged residence times within stratified, alkaline sag-phase lakes controlled the water chemistry, increasing Mg/Ca ratios and alkalinity. This geochemical evolution was a critical factor for the extensive precipitation of the non-marine abiotic and microbial carbonates that constitute the primary reservoir facies."
co2 degassing,Geological Process,The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geochemical process' that modifies geological objects by driving mineral dissolution.,"CO2 degassing is a geochemical process that involves the exsolution of dissolved carbon dioxide from formation fluids, such as oil or brine, triggered by a decrease in pressure. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs, this process is a critical diagenetic agent, as the resulting acidification of pore waters drives intense mineral dissolution. This dissolution creates the vuggy and cavernous porosity that constitutes the most productive zones of the reservoirs."
continuity,quality,"The NLD explicitly defines continuity as a 'fundamental reservoir property' that describes the extent and connectedness of a rock body, which aligns with the definition of a quality inhering in an independent continuant.",Continuity is a fundamental reservoir property that describes the lateral and vertical extent of a connected rock body and its associated fluid-flow characteristics. This property is a primary control on reservoir compartmentalization and production performance within the heterogeneous carbonate facies of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. It directly influences the estimation of hydrocarbon volumes and the design of development strategies.
growth strata,Depositional System,"The NLD defines the term as 'stratigraphic successions that are deposited', which aligns with a Depositional System being an object aggregate of linked depositional units.","Growth strata are syn-tectonic stratigraphic successions that are deposited contemporaneously with active structural deformation, characteristically exhibiting systematic thickness and facies variations toward the controlling structure. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt's lacustrine rift setting, these successions thicken into active half-grabens, providing a primary exploration tool for mapping fault timing and locating thicker carbonate reservoir intervals."
net pay,Thickness,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'cumulative thickness' of a reservoir interval, which is a direct match to this category.","Net pay is a cumulative thickness of a reservoir interval that satisfies predefined petrophysical cutoffs for porosity, permeability, and hydrocarbon saturation. These cutoffs delineate the portion of the reservoir from which hydrocarbons can be produced at commercial rates. This interval represents the economically viable part of a petroleum accumulation."
seismic illumination,quality,"The NLD defines the term as a 'geophysical attribute that quantifies the distribution and intensity' of seismic energy, which aligns with the BFO definition of a quality as a specifically dependent continuant that characterizes its bearer.","Seismic illumination is a geophysical attribute that quantifies the distribution and intensity of seismic raypaths that reach a subsurface target and are recorded at the surface. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, its quality is predominantly governed by the complex geometry and high velocity of the overlying salt layer, which creates poorly imaged shadow zones over the target reservoirs. This attribute is therefore critical for assessing the confidence in seismic interpretations of sub-salt carbonate facies and for optimizing survey design."
chemical deposit,Sedimentary Rock,The NLD explicitly states that a chemical deposit is a type of sedimentary rock formed by the inorganic precipitation of minerals.,"A chemical deposit is a sedimentary rock that is formed by the inorganic precipitation of minerals, such as halite and anhydrite, from a hypersaline aqueous solution due to intense evaporation. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these deposits constitute the extensive Aptian evaporite sequence. This sequence functions as the primary regional seal for the underlying lacustrine carbonate reservoirs."
subaerial erosion,Geological Process,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geological process' that modifies rock material, which directly aligns with the definition of the GeoCore category Geological Process.","Subaerial erosion is a geological process that involves the physical removal and chemical dissolution of rock material exposed to the atmosphere. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonate successions, this process is driven by meteoric water during periods of lake-level fall, resulting in the development of karst features. This diagenetic overprint is a primary control on creating vuggy and cavernous secondary porosity, which significantly enhances reservoir quality."
holocene,Geological Time Interval,"The NLD explicitly defines the term as a 'geological epoch' and a 'time interval', which is a temporal region within the Global Geological Time.","The Holocene is the current geological epoch of the Quaternary Period that, in the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, is primarily significant as the time interval whose modern carbonate depositional systems serve as critical analogs for the Aptian reservoirs. Beginning approximately 11,700 years ago after the last major glaciation, its deposits form the unconsolidated sedimentary cover on the present-day seafloor. These recent sediments are positioned stratigraphically far above the Cretaceous petroleum system."
carbon stable isotope,quality,"The NLD defines the term by its measurable characteristic, the ""relative abundance"" or ""isotopic signature,"" which is a specifically dependent continuant that inheres in some material.","A carbon stable isotope is a non-radioactive nuclide of the element carbon whose relative abundance (¹³C/¹²C) serves as a fundamental geochemical proxy. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, variations in its isotopic signature (δ¹³C) within carbonate minerals are used to interpret lacustrine paleoenvironmental conditions, fluid-rock interaction pathways during diagenesis, and the influence of microbial versus inorganic processes on reservoir formation."
depositional gradient,quality,"The NLD defines the term as a 'measure of the slope,' which is a characteristic that inheres in a surface, fitting the definition of a BFO quality.","A depositional gradient is a measure of the slope of the surface of sediment accumulation that directly influences the hydrodynamic energy, accommodation space, and resulting facies distribution. Within Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine systems, it is the primary control governing the architecture and lateral continuity of key carbonate reservoirs, such as microbialite buildups and coquina shoals."
escarpment,Geological Boundary,"The NLD defines an escarpment as a steep slope that separates two distinct structural blocks (a horst and a graben), which aligns with its classification as a physical discontinuity or boundary between geological objects.","An escarpment is a steep, linear submarine slope that is formed by a major rift-related normal fault system. This geomorphological feature typically separates a structural high (horst), which is a preferential site for carbonate reservoir development, from an adjacent structural low (graben). The fault system creating the escarpment is a fundamental element of the structural trap and often acts as a migration pathway for hydrocarbons from the source rock."
oxygen stable isotope,object,"The NLD defines the term as a 'nuclide of oxygen', which is a type of atom, a canonical example of a BFO object as it is a material entity with causal unity.","An oxygen stable isotope is a non-radioactive nuclide of oxygen whose abundance ratio in carbonate minerals serves as a geochemical proxy for the temperature and composition of formative fluids. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this proxy is essential for reconstructing the paleo-salinity of depositional lacustrine environments and for tracing the diagenetic pathways that control reservoir quality. The analysis of this ratio, typically expressed as δ¹⁸O, helps to constrain the evolution of fluid-rock interaction from deposition through burial."
terminal splay deposit,Lobe Unit,"The NLD describes the term as a 'lobate to fan-shaped' sedimentary body formed by deposition, which directly aligns with the definition of a Lobe Unit as a Depositional Unit with Lobe Geometry.","A terminal splay deposit is a lobate to fan-shaped siliciclastic sedimentary body that is formed by the deposition of sediment from unconfined, decelerating flows at the terminus of a distributive channel system prograding into a lacustrine basin. It is typically composed of sandstones and conglomerates exhibiting tractional sedimentary structures. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these deposits represent significant siliciclastic reservoirs that interfinger with lacustrine carbonate source and reservoir facies."
