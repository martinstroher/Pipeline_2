dolomite,"Dolomite is a sedimentary carbonate rock that is composed predominantly of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO₃)₂. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is a diagenetic product that typically forms through the replacement of precursor calcite and aragonite in microbialite or coquina facies. This dolomitization process is a critical control on reservoir quality, capable of creating, enhancing, or occluding the pore system."
fault,"A fault is a structural discontinuity that exhibits shear displacement between adjacent rock blocks. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these are predominantly basement-involved normal faults that define the rift-related horst and graben architecture. This framework is critical as it creates both the structural traps for hydrocarbon accumulation and the primary conduits for migration from source to reservoir."
rift,"A rift is an elongate tectonic basin that is formed by continental lithospheric extension and bounded by high-angle normal faults. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt province, this Early Cretaceous tectonic event created the fundamental basin architecture of horsts and grabens, which controlled the deposition of lacustrine source rocks in the lows. The inherited rift topography subsequently focused the accumulation of the overlying sag-phase carbonate reservoirs on structural highs prior to the deposition of the regional salt seal."
aptian,"The Aptian is a chronostratigraphic stage of the Early Cretaceous that, in the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, encompasses the deposition of the main lacustrine carbonate reservoirs of the sag phase. This interval is characterized by the development of extensive microbialite and coquina facies within a restricted continental setting. It is immediately overlain by the thick evaporitic sequence that forms the regional seal of the petroleum system."
reservoir,"A reservoir is a subsurface rock body that possesses a connected pore system capable of storing and transmitting economically significant volumes of hydrocarbons within a geological trap. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt province, these are predominantly Aptian microbial carbonates and spherulites sealed by a thick evaporitic sequence. This specific configuration forms traps for vast accumulations of light oil and associated gas."
sediment,"A sediment is a naturally occurring unconsolidated material that consists of an accumulation of discrete particles generated by biological, chemical, or physical weathering processes. Within the sag-phase lacustrine systems of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this material is primarily composed of intrabasinal carbonates, such as microbial precipitates and bioclastic fragments, which form the precursor to reservoir facies. The character and distribution of these sediments fundamentally control the initial properties of the subsequent source, reservoir, and seal rocks of the petroleum system."

In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these rocks are typically composed of non-skeletal grains, such as spherulites and ooids, deposited in high-energy lacustrine shoal environments. Due to their high primary porosity and permeability, these facies constitute the most prolific petroleum reservoirs in the province."
permeable,"Permeable is a quality of a reservoir rock that describes its capacity to transmit fluids, which is governed by the connectivity of its pore system. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this quality is highly heterogeneous within microbial and spherulitic carbonates, where effective fluid flow is critically dependent on the interconnection of vuggy, interparticle, and fracture porosity. This property is the primary control on the producibility of a reservoir and its ability to deliver hydrocarbons to a wellbore at economic rates."
reservoir quality,"Reservoir quality is a collective measure of a rock's petrophysical properties, primarily porosity and permeability, that governs its capacity to store and effectively transmit hydrocarbons. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine carbonates, this measure is fundamentally controlled by the complex interplay between original depositional facies and subsequent diagenetic overprinting. This interaction ultimately determines the final pore system's geometry, connectivity, and producibility."

This interpretive unit is inferred to correspond to a specific depositional system or lithofacies association, which is critical for differentiating the complex carbonate reservoir bodies of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its analysis enables the prediction of key reservoir facies, such as microbialites and coquinas, and their distinction from surrounding lacustrine source rocks and volcanic intrusions."
diagenesis,"Diagenesis is the sum of all physical, chemical, and biological processes that alter a sediment after its initial deposition and throughout its burial history, exclusive of weathering and metamorphism. In the lacustrine carbonates of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these processes are the primary control on reservoir quality, with burial-related dissolution by CO2-rich fluids being the dominant mechanism for generating the extensive secondary porosity that characterizes these prolific reservoirs."
erosion,"Erosion is a geological process that removes and transports geological materials, such as rock fragments and solutes, from a surface via agents like flowing water or wind. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, subaerial erosion during periods of relative sea-level fall is the primary mechanism for developing karst features and secondary porosity that create high-quality carbonate reservoirs. This process generates major unconformities that act as key surfaces within the petroleum system, influencing reservoir distribution and seal integrity."
lacustrine carbonate,"A lacustrine carbonate is a non-marine carbonate rock that, in the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, is precipitated chemically and biogenically in a saline-alkaline rift lake system.

These deposits are characteristic of the Aptian sag section and are fundamental to understanding reservoir quality and distribution."
packstone,"A packstone is a grain-supported carbonate rock that is characterized by a fabric where constituent allochems are in contact and the interparticle volume is filled with carbonate mud. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these allochems are typically non-traditional grains like spherulites, peloids, and fragments of calcareous shrubs. The presence of this mud matrix significantly reduces primary reservoir quality compared to a grainstone, making its economic potential highly dependent on diagenetic enhancement."
shrub,"A shrub is a microbial carbonate that is characterized by a macroscopic, dendritic, branching fabric formed through organomineralization in a lacustrine setting. It is a fundamental building block of the highly productive Aptian-age reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt.

Associated with the Early Cretaceous South Atlantic rifting, it forms a high-impedance acoustic basement beneath the sag-phase lacustrine deposits. Its presence and thickness are critical controls on the regional geothermal gradient, directly impacting the maturation of the Pre-Salt source rocks."
sag phase,"A sag phase is a stage of post-rift basin evolution that is driven by broad, regional thermal subsidence following the cessation of active crustal extension. This phase creates the critical accommodation space for the deposition of the lacustrine source rocks and microbial carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. The culmination of the sag phase is marked by the deposition of the Aptian evaporites, which form the regional seal for this prolific petroleum system."
compaction,"Compaction is a diagenetic process that reduces the bulk volume and porosity of sediments under the progressive increase of effective stress. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, this process encompasses both mechanical adjustments, like grain crushing and repacking, and chemical dissolution at grain contacts, leading to stylolitization. It is a primary mechanism of reservoir quality degradation that governs the evolution of pore systems and fluid expulsion during burial."
mound,"A mound is a carbonate buildup that forms a positive topographic feature on the lake floor, is composed primarily of in situ precipitated non-skeletal carbonates, and lacks a rigid organic framework. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these buildups are typically formed by microbialites and fascicular calcite crusts in a saline, alkaline lacustrine system. They constitute a primary reservoir facies due to their high depositional porosity and permeability."
silicification,"Silicification is a diagenetic process that involves the replacement of carbonate minerals by authigenic silica, typically as microcrystalline quartz or chert. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process commonly affects lacustrine microbialite and coquina facies, creating low-permeability zones that can act as baffles or seals. This alteration significantly impacts reservoir heterogeneity by occluding primary porosity and modifying fluid flow pathways."
accommodation space,"Accommodation space is the potential depositional volume that exists between the lake surface and the sediment-water interface. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt's lacustrine rift basins, this volume is primarily generated by the interplay between tectonic subsidence and climate-driven lake-level fluctuations. The rate of its creation relative to the carbonate sediment supply rate governs the resulting stratigraphic architecture and reservoir facies distribution."
halite,Halite is an evaporite mineral composed of sodium chloride that constitutes the massive and ductile Aptian salt succession. This succession functions as the principal regional seal for the underlying carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system due to its extremely low permeability. Its ductile flow is also a primary control on the formation of structural traps and the focusing of heat flow into the subsalt section.
cretaceous,"Cretaceous is a geologic period of the Mesozoic Era that encompasses the Early Cretaceous rifting of the South Atlantic and the subsequent deposition of the Brazilian Pre-Salt sag-phase successions. This period is fundamentally important as it includes the formation of the Aptian lacustrine source rocks, microbial carbonate reservoirs, and the overlying regional evaporitic seal. The Late Cretaceous marks the deposition of the initial post-salt marine carbonate section which provides the overburden for hydrocarbon maturation."
evaporation,"Evaporation is a physicochemical process that transforms liquid water into vapor, which in the restricted Aptian sag basin led to the progressive concentration of dissolved salts.

The nature and arrangement of these laminates fundamentally control the heterogeneity and quality of microbialite reservoirs."
recrystallized,"A recrystallized carbonate is a reservoir rock that exhibits a diagenetic fabric resulting from the in-situ transformation of its primary crystals into a new, typically coarser, crystal mosaic. This neomorphic process fundamentally alters the original depositional texture, such as that of microbialites or spherulites, thereby modifying the rock's porosity and permeability system. The alteration occurs in the solid state without changing the essential mineralogy, driven by changes in pore fluid chemistry and temperature during burial."
salt,Salt is an evaporite rock that is predominantly composed of halite and functions as the primary regional seal in the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system.

Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine successions, these grains often consist of microbial fragments, spherulites, and peloids, set in a matrix of precipitated or microbially-mediated calcite mud. Its primary fabric typically has low permeability, but it can form effective reservoirs where diagenetic dissolution has created significant secondary porosity."
peloid,"A peloid is a carbonate allochem that is composed of cryptocrystalline carbonate and lacks a discernible internal nucleus or structure. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these grains are frequently interpreted as being of microbial origin, forming the primary framework of high-energy, lacustrine grainstone facies. Their accumulation is fundamental to the development of extensive reservoir intervals with high interparticle porosity."
secondary porosity,"Secondary porosity is a pore system that develops within a rock subsequent to its deposition, typically resulting from diagenetic processes such as the dissolution of grains and cements by meteoric fluids during subaerial exposure. This process creates interconnected vuggy, moldic, and cavernous pores that significantly enhance the reservoir quality of Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates. It is distinct from primary porosity, which is inherent to the rock at the time of deposition."

Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it constitutes the elementary building block for the characterization of reservoir flow units."
graben,"A graben is an elongated, down-dropped structural block of crust that is bounded by high-angle normal faults formed during continental rifting. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum systems, these rift-phase depressions acted as the principal depocenters for the accumulation and preservation of rich lacustrine source rocks. The resulting horst-and-graben paleotopography subsequently controlled the deposition of the overlying sag-phase carbonate reservoirs."
horst,A horst is an uplifted fault block that is bounded by conjugate normal faults formed during the syn-rift phase of the South Atlantic opening.

It constitutes a primary structural trap for hydrocarbon accumulations beneath the regional salt seal.
lithofacies,"A lithofacies is a body of rock that is defined by a distinctive set of physical, chemical, and biological attributes reflecting specific depositional and diagenetic conditions. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these attributes differentiate key carbonate reservoir types, such as microbialites and coquinas, based on their unique fabric and composition. This classification serves as the fundamental unit for geological modeling and predicting reservoir quality distribution."
seal,"A seal is a lithostratigraphic unit that possesses high capillary entry pressure and extremely low permeability, effectively preventing the vertical or lateral migration of hydrocarbons out of a reservoir. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this function is primarily performed by the thick Aptian evaporite sequence, which forms the regional top seal for the underlying carbonate reservoirs. Intra-formational seals, such as dense carbonate mudstones or tightly cemented coquinas, may also create localized hydrocarbon accumulations within the main reservoir section."

They consequently govern the preferential deposition and preservation of the microbial and coquina carbonate reservoir facies on these elevated features."
transitional environment,"A transitional environment is a depositional setting that occupies an intermediate position between high-energy, shallow lacustrine carbonate factories and low-energy, deep lacustrine depositional sinks. It is characterized by the lateral and vertical interfingering of reservoir-quality grainy carbonates with source- and seal-quality fine-grained sediments. This juxtaposition is fundamental to the development of the prolific Pre-Salt petroleum plays."
bivalve,"A bivalve is a mollusc that functions as a primary rock-forming organism within the lacustrine carbonate successions of the Brazilian Pre-Salt.

This process is fundamental in the evolution of Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, where it commonly manifests as the dolomitization of primary calcite or aragonite microbial frameworks. The resulting texture can either preserve (mimetic) or obliterate the original depositional fabric, directly controlling the final porosity and permeability of the reservoir rock."
build-up,"A build-up is a carbonate sedimentary body that is formed in situ within a lacustrine rift setting, primarily composed of microbially-influenced and chemically precipitated facies such as shrubs and spherulites. This accumulation results in a positive topographic feature that constitutes the primary reservoir interval of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."

This tectonic event establishes the transition from fault-controlled, syn-rift subsidence to a regional, thermally-driven post-rift sag. In the South Atlantic context, this sag phase created the broad, stable accommodation space necessary for the deposition of the extensive lacustrine microbial carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
igneous rock,"An igneous rock is a crystalline rock body that is formed from the solidification of magma associated with South Atlantic rifting.

In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process specifically focuses on delineating the rift-related fault network, the complex geometry of the salt layer, and the distribution of heterogeneous carbonate reservoir facies like coquinas and microbialites. It further involves the analysis of seismic attributes to infer rock properties and fluid contacts, thereby reducing uncertainty in petroleum system characterization."
hydrothermal alteration,"Hydrothermal alteration is a diagenetic process that modifies the mineralogical, chemical, and textural composition of carbonate reservoir rocks through interaction with hot, chemically reactive aqueous fluids. This metasomatic process typically results in the precipitation of authigenic magnesium-silicates, such as talc and stevensite, which replace the original rock fabric and occlude the pore system. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this alteration is a primary mechanism of reservoir quality degradation, causing a significant reduction in porosity and permeability."

neomorphism,"Neomorphism is a diagenetic process that alters the original crystal fabric of a rock through the in-situ transformation of a mineral into a polymorph or a texturally different form of the same mineral. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, this process is fundamental for the stabilization of precursor minerals like aragonite and high-magnesium calcite into low-magnesium calcite. This transformation significantly impacts reservoir texture and porosity evolution by creating coarser, more stable crystal mosaics."
sequence boundary,"A sequence boundary is a stratigraphic surface that is formed by subaerial erosion or non-deposition during a relative fall in base level, and which extends into its correlative conformity in more distal settings. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt's lacustrine carbonate systems, these boundaries are critical surfaces of subaerial exposure that often develop significant karst-related secondary porosity, enhancing reservoir quality."
silica cement,"A silica cement is an authigenic mineral precipitate that is composed of silicon dioxide and crystallizes within the pore system of a rock, reducing its storage capacity and flow potential. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this cement commonly occurs as microcrystalline quartz (chert) or megaquartz that occludes porosity in microbial and coquina carbonate facies. Its primary sources are the dissolution of biogenic silica, such as sponge spicules, and the alteration of interbedded volcaniclastic material."
siliciclastic,"A siliciclastic rock is a sedimentary rock that is composed predominantly of silicate mineral fragments, such as quartz and feldspar, derived from the erosion of continental landmasses.

It is frequently associated with organic-rich source rocks or acts as a low-permeability seal or baffle within the main carbonate reservoir succession."
wave base,"Wave base is a conceptual depth in a water body that marks the lower limit of significant sediment reworking by wave-induced orbital motion. In Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine systems, it is a primary control that separates high-energy depositional settings, where reservoir-quality coquinas and grainstones accumulate, from quiescent, low-energy settings. This depth varies, defining a shallower fair-weather wave base and a deeper storm wave base, which together govern the architecture of carbonate buildups."

pre-salt section,"A pre-salt section is a tectono-stratigraphic succession that comprises the syn-rift and sag phase deposits of the South Atlantic continental margin, positioned stratigraphically below the regional Aptian evaporite layer. This succession is characterized by lacustrine source rocks and unique microbial and bioclastic carbonate reservoirs deposited in a restricted, saline to hypersaline lacustrine system. It constitutes the primary petroleum province of offshore Brazil, where the overlying salt acts as a world-class regional seal."
arid climate,"An arid climate is a paleoclimatic regime that is characterized by evaporation rates that consistently exceed precipitation, leading to a net water deficit.

interparticle porosity,"Interparticle porosity is a type of primary porosity that represents the original void space between the constituent grains, crystals, or clasts of a sedimentary rock. In the lacustrine carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this porosity is fundamentally defined by the spaces between depositional components such as spherulites, microbial fragments, and bioclasts. This pore system forms the initial framework for hydrocarbon storage and fluid flow prior to significant diagenetic alteration."
sag stage,"The sag stage is a tectono-stratigraphic phase of rift basin evolution that follows the syn-rift and is primarily controlled by regional thermal subsidence rather than active faulting. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this subsidence created the widespread, low-gradient accommodation space necessary for the deposition of the prolific lacustrine carbonate reservoirs. This stage culminates with the deposition of the regional Aptian evaporites that form the critical top seal of the petroleum system."
talc,"Talc is an authigenic clay mineral that forms within Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates from the reaction of magnesium-rich fluids with siliceous precursors during diagenesis.

In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs, this porosity is a primary contributor to storage capacity and is characteristically found within the chambers of mollusk bioclasts and the internal fabric of microbial spherulites. This pore system's contribution to reservoir permeability is highly dependent on its connection to the interparticle pore network."
lacustrine system,"A lacustrine system is a continental depositional system that, in the context of the South Atlantic rift, comprises the depositional environments of large, saline-alkaline, and chemically stratified lakes. This system is responsible for the coeval deposition of world-class, anoxic source rocks in profundal zones and unique, microbial to spherulitic carbonate reservoirs in littoral to sub-littoral zones. The interplay between tectonics, climate, and lake hydrochemistry controls the architecture and quality of these key petroleum system elements."

microbial origin,"Microbial origin is a genetic attribute of a geological material that results from the metabolic activities of microorganisms. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, this attribute primarily describes carbonate rocks whose framework was built by microbial communities that induced mineral precipitation or trapped and bound sediment particles. These processes are fundamental to the formation of the highly heterogeneous microbialite facies that constitute the main petroleum reservoirs."
microcrystalline quartz,"Microcrystalline quartz is a textural variety of quartz that consists of an aggregate of interlocking crystals resolvable only under a microscope. Within Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, it is a common authigenic mineral that forms via the diagenetic replacement of precursor carbonates, significantly altering the original rock fabric and pore system. Its precipitation is typically associated with silica-rich fluids active during the sag phase."
oncoid,"An oncoid is a coated carbonate grain that is formed by the microbial accretion of irregular, concentric laminae around a nucleus. These grains are fundamental components of the high-porosity lacustrine grainstone and rudstone reservoir facies characteristic of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
slope,"A slope is a physiographic element of a lacustrine carbonate depositional system that connects the higher-energy platform margin to the deeper, lower-energy basin floor. It is characterized by a distinct topographic gradient where gravity-driven processes, such as debris flows and grain flows, transport and redeposit carbonate sediments. These resedimented deposits, often forming clastic aprons of breccias and grainstones, constitute significant reservoir facies in the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
volcanic fragment,"A volcanic fragment is a rock clast that is derived from the fragmentation of syn-rift volcanic rocks and incorporated as an allochthonous component within Pre-Salt lacustrine successions, where its diagenetic alteration impacts reservoir quality."
aggradation,"Aggradation is a stratal stacking pattern that describes the predominantly vertical accumulation of carbonate deposits, such as microbialites and coquinas, within a lacustrine rift basin. This pattern occurs when the rate of in-situ carbonate production is balanced by the rate of accommodation created by tectonic subsidence and lake-level rise. It results in the formation of thick, vertically stacked successions that can constitute significant reservoir intervals."
amplitude,"Amplitude is a fundamental seismic attribute that quantifies the magnitude of a reflection event recorded on a seismic trace. This value is primarily controlled by the acoustic impedance contrast across a geological interface, such as the boundary between evaporites and the underlying microbial carbonate reservoirs. Variations in amplitude are therefore critical for mapping reservoir boundaries, faults, and internal diagenetic heterogeneities within the Brazilian Pre-Salt section."
crustal thinning,"Crustal thinning is a tectonic process that involves the vertical reduction of the Earth's crust in response to extensional forces. This process governed the South Atlantic rifting, creating the fundamental accommodation space for the deposition of the Brazilian Pre-Salt sag phase, including its prolific source rocks and carbonate reservoirs. The associated asthenospheric upwelling resulted in an elevated geothermal gradient, which was critical for the maturation of the petroleum system."
drift,"A drift is a tectono-stratigraphic supersequence that represents the post-rift thermal subsidence stage of the South Atlantic passive margin. It is characterized by the deposition of open marine sediments, such as shales and marls, which unconformably overlie the Pre-Salt sag sequence. This succession typically contains the regional seal rocks that trap hydrocarbons within the underlying Pre-Salt reservoirs."
halokinesis,"Halokinesis is a geological process that describes the subsurface flow of evaporitic sequences, such as the Aptian salt, driven by their low density and ductility under differential sedimentary loading. This salt movement is a primary control on the formation of structural traps and the architecture of underlying pre-salt carbonate reservoirs. The process results in complex geometries including salt walls, diapirs, and welds that influence hydrocarbon migration and accumulation."
hanging wall,"A hanging wall is the fault block that is positioned above an inclined fault plane. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this block is down-thrown during rifting and typically contains the syn-rift lacustrine source rocks. The resulting half-graben accommodation space is subsequently filled and sealed by the Aptian evaporite sequence."
high-energy environment,"A high-energy environment is a lacustrine depositional setting that is dominated by persistent wave action sufficient to rework, sort, and transport carbonate grains. This process leads to the accumulation of grain-supported deposits, such as coquinas and spherulitic grainstones. These well-sorted facies typically form the highest quality reservoir intervals within the Brazilian Pre-Salt succession."
lithosphere,"The lithosphere is the rigid outer mechanical layer of the Earth that comprises the crust and the uppermost mantle, governing large-scale tectonics through its brittle-elastic response to stress. The extensional thinning of the continental lithosphere during the breakup of Gondwana dictated the architecture of the rift basins and the elevated geothermal gradient required for the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system. Subsequent thermal subsidence of this thinned lithosphere created the accommodation space for the thick sag and evaporite sequences."
oil accumulation,"An oil accumulation is a discrete body of crude oil that has migrated from a source rock and is held by a trapping mechanism within the pore space of a reservoir rock. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these accumulations are characteristically found in lacustrine carbonate reservoirs, such as microbialites and coquinas, sourced from organic-rich shales and sealed by a thick overlying evaporite sequence. The traps are typically large, combined structural-stratigraphic features related to rift-phase horst blocks."
reservoir characteristic,"A reservoir characteristic is a geological, petrophysical, or geochemical property that governs the capacity of a reservoir to store, transmit, and produce fluids. Such properties, including porosity, permeability, fluid saturation, and fracture network geometry, are defined at multiple scales from pore to field. Their integrated characterization is critical for quantifying hydrocarbon volumes and predicting dynamic reservoir performance."
salt tectonics,"Salt tectonics is a set of geological deformational processes that is driven by the density contrast and viscous flow of a thick evaporite layer in response to differential loading by overlying sediments. In the Brazilian continental margin, this halokinesis governs the post-rift architecture, creating complex allochthonous salt bodies, welds, and intervening depocenters known as minibasins. These salt-related structures are critical elements of the Pre-Salt petroleum system, providing the ultimate regional seal and forming the large structural traps for the underlying carbonate reservoirs."
seismic pattern,"A seismic pattern is a distinct and recognizable configuration of seismic reflections that is interpreted to represent a specific depositional environment, structural style, or lithofacies association based on its geometry and reflector characteristics. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, mounded and chaotic internal reflection patterns are diagnostic of microbial carbonate buildups, whereas sub-parallel, high-continuity reflectors characterize the sag-phase lacustrine source rocks."
seismic resolution,"Seismic resolution is a measure that quantifies the minimum separation at which two adjacent geological features can be distinguished on a seismic dataset. This property is critical in the Brazilian Pre-Salt for imaging the boundaries of complex carbonate reservoirs, such as microbialite buildups and coquinas, located beneath the thick, signal-attenuating salt canopy. The resolving power is fundamentally limited by the seismic signal's wavelength."
chert,"Chert is a microcrystalline siliceous rock that forms primarily through the diagenetic replacement of precursor carbonate minerals within the lacustrine successions of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its occurrence as nodules, cements, or pervasive silicified bodies significantly alters original reservoir properties by reducing matrix porosity and permeability. However, due to its brittle nature, chert-rich intervals are prone to fracturing, which can create essential secondary permeability pathways in otherwise tight reservoir zones."
conglomerate,"A conglomerate is a clastic sedimentary rock that is composed of predominantly rounded to sub-rounded, gravel-sized clasts (>2 mm in diameter) cemented within a finer-grained matrix. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these deposits typically form as either siliciclastic fanglomerates sourced from rift-margin fault scarps or as carbonate rudstones resulting from the high-energy reworking of microbial buildups and coquinas. They can constitute significant reservoir facies, particularly where primary interparticle porosity is preserved or enhanced by dissolution."
desiccation,"Desiccation is an early diagenetic process that results from the removal of pore water and subsequent shrinkage of sediment following subaerial exposure. In the lacustrine carbonate successions of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process forms polygonal crack networks in microbialites and mudstones, which act as critical indicators of lake-level fall and can create fracture systems that enhance reservoir permeability."
isotope analysis,"Isotope analysis is an analytical method that quantifies the relative abundance of isotopes of specific elements within geological materials. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is principally applied to carbonate reservoirs, source rocks, and fluids to constrain chemostratigraphy, reconstruct diagenetic histories, and trace the origin and migration of hydrocarbons. This method is critical for understanding the unique lacustrine depositional systems and subsequent fluid-rock interactions that define these reservoirs."
carbonate factory,"A carbonate factory is a depositional system that generates carbonate sediments in situ through biological and/or physicochemical processes. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these factories operated in restricted, alkaline lacustrine to transitional settings, dominated by microbial communities and the direct precipitation of calcium carbonate spherulites. The resulting deposits form the primary source material for the highly complex microbialite and grainstone reservoirs of the sag-phase succession."
deformation,"Deformation is a geological process that modifies the original shape, size, or orientation of rock bodies in response to tectonic stresses, resulting in the formation of geological structures. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is primarily driven by continental rifting and subsequent halokinesis of the Aptian salt layer. These resultant structures, including horsts, faulted blocks, and salt-induced anticlines, form the primary structural traps and fracture networks that control hydrocarbon accumulations in the carbonate reservoirs."
downlap,"Downlap is a baselap termination in which initially inclined strata terminate downdip against a less inclined or horizontal lower surface, such as a sequence boundary. This pattern represents sediment progradation and is a primary indicator of the basinward extent of depositional systems. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is critical for delineating the geometry of prograding carbonate reservoir bodies like coquina banks and microbial buildups."
erosional truncation,"Erosional truncation is a stratigraphic termination that occurs where underlying, typically tilted, rock layers are cut off by an overlying surface of erosion, known as an unconformity. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this feature commonly defines the upper boundary of syn-rift carbonate reservoirs beneath the base-of-salt unconformity. This geometry is a critical element in forming stratigraphic traps, where porous reservoir facies are terminated against overlying sealing rocks."
extension,"Extension is a tectonic process that causes the stretching and thinning of the continental lithosphere through normal faulting. This deformation created the South Atlantic rift system, generating the horst and graben architecture that controlled the deposition and preservation of the Pre-Salt petroleum system elements. The resulting structural highs form the primary traps for the vast microbial carbonate reservoirs."
fault reactivation,"Fault reactivation is a tectonic process that involves renewed slip along a pre-existing fault or structural weakness in response to a change in the orientation or magnitude of the regional stress field. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this mechanism is critical for controlling the structural framework of the sag-phase carbonate reservoirs, often by reactivating basement faults from the Gondwana rift phase. Such reactivation influences reservoir compartmentalization, the development of fracture networks, and the pathways for hydrocarbon migration and charge."
fault block,"A fault block is a crustal block that is bounded by major rift-related normal faults and has undergone vertical and/or rotational displacement relative to adjacent blocks. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these blocks form the fundamental structural framework of the syn-rift section. The elevated blocks (horsts) create paleohighs for the development of carbonate reservoirs, while the down-dropped blocks (grabens) form depocenters for lacustrine source rocks."
feldspar,"Feldspar is a group of rock-forming tectosilicate minerals that is a primary constituent of the crystalline basement and a significant detrital component within syn-rift siliciclastic sequences of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its alteration products, primarily clay minerals, are fundamental to the composition of the prolific lacustrine source and seal rocks. This makes it a critical mineral for understanding the complete petroleum system, from provenance to the formation of source and seal facies."
lacustrine setting,"A lacustrine setting is a continental depositional environment that, in the Brazilian Pre-Salt, corresponds to a large-scale, saline-alkaline lake system developed within a rift basin. This environment is characterized by the prolific development of microbial and bioclastic carbonates, which form the main reservoirs. It also encompasses the deposition of the organic-rich shales that constitute the primary source rocks of the petroleum system."
magmatic,"Magmatic is a characteristic of a geological material or process that indicates an origin from the cooling and crystallization of molten rock. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this term primarily describes the mafic igneous intrusions and extrusions emplaced during the South Atlantic rifting. These igneous bodies critically influence reservoir quality, thermal maturity, and seismic imaging within the petroleum system."
stratigraphic framework,"A stratigraphic framework is a conceptual geological model that organizes sedimentary successions into a predictive spatial and temporal arrangement based on genetically related depositional units bounded by chronostratigraphically significant surfaces. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this model is essential for delineating the architecture of syn-rift to sag-phase sequences, including the distribution of lacustrine source rocks, microbialite and coquina reservoirs, and the regional evaporitic seal. The framework integrates seismic, well, and core data to establish correlations and constrain the geometry of petroleum system elements across the basin."
syn-deposition fault,"A syn-deposition fault is a fault that exhibits displacement contemporaneous with the accumulation of adjacent sedimentary strata. Its activity creates accommodation space, characteristically causing stratigraphic expansion in the hanging wall and potential thinning or onlap onto the footwall. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these extensional faults are fundamental controls on the architecture and heterogeneity of the lacustrine carbonate reservoir systems."
tectonic setting,"A tectonic setting is a geodynamic environment that is characterized by the specific stress regime and structural architecture resulting from the interaction of lithospheric plates. This environment fundamentally governs the genesis and evolution of sedimentary basins, controlling the development and distribution of key petroleum system elements. It dictates the creation of accommodation space for deposition, such as the grabens that hosted the Pre-Salt lacustrine source rocks and carbonate reservoirs."
accommodation,"Accommodation is the geological space available for sediment accumulation that is primarily controlled by the interplay between tectonic subsidence and lacustrine base-level fluctuations. The relationship between the rate of accommodation creation and the rate of carbonate production governs the stratigraphic architecture and facies distribution of reservoir units. Consequently, variations in accommodation directly influence the development, preservation, and vertical stacking patterns of microbial and coquina carbonate reservoirs."
stratigraphic architecture,"Stratigraphic architecture is the three-dimensional framework of genetically related depositional sequences that defines the geometry, spatial distribution, and connectivity of rock bodies. This framework results from the interplay of tectonics, base-level changes, and sediment supply. It ultimately controls the distribution and quality of reservoir facies, such as the lacustrine carbonates of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, within a petroleum system."
fragment,"A fragment is a carbonate clast that is derived from the mechanical breakdown of pre-existing, syn-depositional materials within the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine system. These clasts are commonly composed of microbialite, spherulite, or mollusc shell material. Their accumulation forms high-energy deposits such as rudstones and breccias, where interparticle porosity can constitute significant reservoir volume."
chemical precipitate,"A chemical precipitate is a crystalline solid that forms by direct nucleation from a supersaturated aqueous solution due to changes in its physicochemical conditions. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is fundamental to the formation of carbonate reservoir facies from lacustrine brines, where supersaturation is primarily driven by evaporation and microbially-mediated changes in water chemistry."
hydrocarbon accumulation,"A hydrocarbon accumulation is a discrete subsurface body of movable petroleum that is confined within a geological trap formed by a reservoir and an overlying seal. This trap prevents the upward migration of hydrocarbons, allowing them to collect in potentially economic quantities. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt province, these accumulations are predominantly found in large structural highs involving lacustrine carbonate reservoirs sealed by thick evaporite sequences."
hydrothermal process,"A hydrothermal process is a diagenetic process driven by the circulation of heated, chemically reactive aqueous fluids that profoundly alters the primary rock fabric through mineral dissolution, precipitation, and replacement. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is frequently linked to Aptian magmatism and rift-related high heat flow, mobilizing fluids that interact with the carbonate and evaporite sequences. This interaction is a primary control on reservoir quality, creating extreme heterogeneity by forming both high-permeability conduits and cemented barriers."
pore system,"A pore system is a three-dimensional network of voids within a rock that governs the storage (porosity) and flow (permeability) of fluids through its interconnected pores, vugs, and fractures. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, this network is exceptionally complex, resulting from intense diagenetic overprinting of primary depositional fabrics such as coquinas and microbialites. The architecture of this system is the primary control on reservoir quality and hydrocarbon producibility."
primary porosity,"Primary porosity is a class of pore space that is created during the deposition of sediments or during eodiagenesis, and is therefore inherent to the original rock fabric. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, it encompasses interparticle voids between spherulites or bioclasts, intraparticle voids within bivalve shells, and growth-framework or fenestral voids in microbialites. This initial pore system provides the fundamental template upon which subsequent diagenetic processes, such as dissolution and cementation, act to modify the reservoir quality."
pyrite,"Pyrite is an iron sulfide mineral (FeS₂) that is a common authigenic phase within the lacustrine source and reservoir rocks of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its formation is primarily associated with bacterial sulfate reduction in anoxic depositional and early diagenetic environments, making it a key indicator for the preservation potential of organic matter. Within reservoir facies, it typically occurs as disseminated crystals or framboids, reflecting localized reducing conditions during diagenesis."
sedimentology,"Sedimentology is a geoscience discipline that investigates the processes of formation, transport, deposition, and diagenesis of sediments and sedimentary rocks. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it focuses on the characterization of non-marine carbonate facies, such as microbialites and spherulites, to interpret their unique lacustrine depositional systems. This interpretation is critical for building predictive models of reservoir architecture, distribution, and quality."
syngenetic precipitate,"A syngenetic precipitate is a mineral phase that crystallizes directly from the depositional water column or pore fluids contemporaneously with the accumulation of the surrounding sediment. In the lacustrine carbonate systems of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these precipitates, such as microbially-mediated calcite or early magnesite, form an integral part of the primary rock fabric. Their formation is a key process that controls the initial reservoir quality by creating or occluding primary porosity."
wave,"A wave is a surface water oscillation that transfers energy, typically from wind, across the surface of a fluid body. Within the lacustrine systems of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this hydrodynamic process was the primary agent for the transport, sorting, and reworking of carbonate sediments. This action directly controlled the development of reservoir facies architecture and quality."
gypsum,"Gypsum is a hydrated calcium sulfate evaporite mineral that precipitates from hypersaline brines in restricted depositional environments. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is a primary constituent of the Aptian evaporite succession, which acts as the regional top seal for the underlying carbonate reservoirs. During burial, it commonly dehydrates to form anhydrite, a process critical to understanding the geomechanical properties and sealing integrity of the salt layer."
wave action,"Wave action is a physical sedimentary process that reworks, abrades, and sorts unconsolidated lacustrine carbonate sediments within the zone of influence above the wave base. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is a primary control on the deposition of high-energy, grain-supported facies, such as coquinas and spherulitic grainstones. These well-sorted facies form the highest quality reservoirs by winnowing mud and creating effective interparticle porosity."
vertical resolution,"Vertical resolution is the ability of a geophysical dataset to distinguish between two closely spaced geological interfaces in the vertical dimension. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this property dictates the minimum thickness of a carbonate reservoir layer, such as a coquina, that can be individually resolved from seismic reflection or well log data. It is fundamentally limited by the dominant frequency of the seismic wavelet or the physical design of the logging instrument."
accumulation,"An accumulation is a discrete body of petroleum that is confined within a subsurface geological trap. It is characterized by a common pressure system and is defined by a hydrocarbon-water contact. This entrapment results from the juxtaposition of a porous and permeable reservoir, such as the Pre-Salt microbial carbonates, against a sealing rock that intercepts the hydrocarbon migration pathway."
geochemistry,"Geochemistry is a branch of geoscience that investigates the chemical composition, distribution, and isotopic signatures of Earth materials. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is fundamentally applied to characterize the organic matter of lacustrine source rocks, correlate hydrocarbons to their source, and quantify the diagenetic processes controlling the evolution of carbonate reservoir quality. This discipline provides critical data for defining the petroleum system and predicting fluid properties."
subaerial exposure,"Subaerial exposure is a geological process that subjects previously submerged carbonate deposits to atmospheric conditions due to a relative fall in base level. This process initiates meteoric diagenesis, which is critical for creating secondary porosity and extensive karst features through dissolution. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these exposure events are a primary control on reservoir quality, creating high-permeability conduits and vuggy porosity systems within the Aptian microbialite and coquina facies."
tectonic evolution,"Tectonic evolution is a geological process that describes the sequence of crustal deformation events, from the continental rifting of Gondwana to the subsequent sag and drift phases, that governed the formation and architecture of the South Atlantic passive margin basins. This process directly controlled the creation of accommodation space for the deposition of pre-salt source rocks and carbonate reservoirs. Furthermore, it established the thermal regime for hydrocarbon generation and the formation of structural traps sealed by the Aptian salt."
in situ deposit,"An in situ deposit is a carbonate sedimentary body that is constituted by components which grew, accumulated, or precipitated at their final site of deposition without significant subsequent transport. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine reservoirs, this primarily includes microbialites, such as stromatolites and thrombolites, and autochthonous coquinas. These deposits form key reservoir facies where the original depositional fabric strongly influences porosity and permeability."
mud,Mud is a fine-grained carbonate sediment that is composed of microcrystalline calcite originating from microbial and/or inorganic precipitation within the Pre-Salt's alkaline lacustrine depositional system. This material constitutes the primary matrix for the reservoir facies and is a key component of the organic-rich source rock intervals. Its distribution is a fundamental control on the petrophysical properties and heterogeneity of the reservoir.

reservoir property,"A reservoir property is a quantifiable petrophysical or geological attribute of a rock that defines its capacity to store and transmit fluids. These properties, such as porosity, permeability, and water saturation, are fundamental for assessing hydrocarbon volumes and producibility. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, their values and distribution are heterogeneously controlled by the complex interplay between depositional facies and multi-stage diagenesis in carbonate successions."
cementstone,"A cementstone is a crystalline carbonate rock that is supported by its cement framework, in which original depositional components are not in contact. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this fabric is characteristically composed of primary or early diagenetic calcite cements, such as spherulites, precipitated directly from the alkaline lacustrine water column. This rock type can form significant reservoir intervals when intercrystalline or vuggy porosity is preserved between the cement crystals."
displacive,"Displacive is a textural attribute that describes an authigenic mineral that has grown within a pre-existing sedimentary fabric, physically forcing apart and deforming the host components. This process is common in Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, where evaporite minerals such as halite grow within microbialite or coquina facies. The resulting texture is distinct from pore-filling cementation or fabric-replacive textures."
fascicular-optic calcite,"Fascicular-optic calcite is a primary, abiogenic calcite crystal habit that is composed of radiating, fan-like bundles of fibrous to bladed sub-crystals which exhibit sweeping undulose extinction under cross-polarized light. This fabric is characteristic of precipitation from the highly alkaline and silica-rich lacustrine waters typical of the Brazilian Pre-Salt sag phase. It constitutes the fundamental framework-building component of microbialite and spherulitic grainstone reservoirs, where its growth fabric dictates the primary intercrystalline porosity."
lacustrine coquina,"A lacustrine coquina is a bioclastic carbonate rock that is predominantly composed of reworked and accumulated shells and fragments of endemic lacustrine bivalves and gastropods. It is deposited in high-energy, shallow-water lake margin settings, such as shoals and shorefaces, characteristic of the Aptian sag phase in the Santos and Campos basins. Subsequent diagenesis, particularly the dissolution of aragonitic bioclasts, often creates high-porosity and high-permeability intervals, forming the most significant petroleum reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
lake margin,"A lake margin is a transitional depositional setting that separates a lacustrine domain from adjacent subaerial or fluvial environments. Within the sag phase of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it represents a high-energy, wave-agitated zone characterized by the development of prolific microbial and bioclastic carbonate factories. These factories are responsible for the accumulation of key reservoir facies, including coquina shoals and stromatolitic buildups."
layer,"A layer is a tabular to lenticular stratigraphic rock unit that is characterized by a set of relatively homogeneous lithological, sedimentological, and petrophysical properties distinct from those in adjacent units.

microcrystalline silica,"Microcrystalline silica is a diagenetic mineral, composed of microscopic quartz crystals, that commonly replaces precursor carbonate minerals or precipitates as a pore-filling cement within the lacustrine reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its precipitation is often driven by pH fluctuations in alkaline lacustrine settings, mobilizing silica from sources such as volcaniclastics, clay minerals, or biogenic components. This silicification process typically results in a significant reduction of reservoir porosity and permeability, acting as a major control on reservoir quality distribution."
sedimentary structure,"A sedimentary structure is a macroscopic geometric feature that is formed within a sediment at or near the time of deposition by physical, chemical, or biological processes. These features are preserved upon lithification and serve as primary indicators of depositional processes, hydrodynamic energy, and paleoenvironmental conditions. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, key examples include microbial laminations and shrub fabrics that indicate biogenic influence, and graded bedding in coquinas that signifies high-energy depositional events."
silica precipitation,"Silica precipitation is a diagenetic process that results in the formation of authigenic silica minerals from pore fluids. Within the lacustrine carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it primarily occurs as chert or microcrystalline quartz that replaces carbonate constituents and cements primary and secondary porosity. This process is a major control on reservoir quality degradation, creating low-permeability barriers and significantly reducing hydrocarbon storage capacity."
spherulitestone,"A spherulitestone is a non-skeletal carbonate rock that is composed predominantly of spherulites. These spherulites are typically radial aggregates of calcite crystals interpreted to have precipitated abiotically or with microbial influence from the supersaturated alkaline waters of a lacustrine system. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this facies constitutes significant reservoir intervals characterized by high primary interparticle porosity."
stylolite,"A stylolite is a planar diagenetic feature that results from pressure-dissolution and chemical compaction within a rock mass. It is characterized by an irregular, serrated geometry along which insoluble materials, including clays and solid bitumen, accumulate. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, these features commonly form extensive, low-permeability barriers that create significant reservoir compartmentalization."
vertical growth,"Vertical growth is a depositional style of carbonate buildups that is dominated by upward aggradation, resulting in vertically stacked facies. This process occurs when the rate of carbonate production, typically from microbial or shelly communities, equals or exceeds the rate of accommodation space creation from relative water level rise. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this style is fundamental to the formation of thick, high-quality lacustrine carbonate reservoirs with significant vertical connectivity."
vug,"A vug is a secondary pore within a carbonate reservoir that is substantially larger than the rock's fabric-forming components, such as spherulites or microbial shrubs. It is created by the localized dissolution of more soluble minerals, with boundaries that typically cut across the primary depositional fabric. This pore type is a critical contributor to the development of high-permeability pathways, particularly within the microbialite and spherulite facies of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
aggrading geometry,"An aggrading geometry is a stratigraphic stacking pattern that is characterized by the vertical accretion of depositional units with minimal lateral displacement of facies. This geometry forms when sediment supply rates match accommodation creation rates, a critical process for developing the thick, vertically extensive microbialite and coquina reservoirs in the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
bioclastic grainstone,"A bioclastic grainstone is a grain-supported carbonate rock that is composed of skeletal fragments, primarily from bivalves and calcareous shrubs, and is devoid of a primary micritic matrix. This lithofacies is indicative of a high-energy depositional environment within the sag-phase lacustrine system of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its significant primary interparticle porosity, often enhanced by diagenesis, makes it a principal component of the most productive petroleum reservoirs in the province."
channel,"A channel is an elongate, concave-up geobody that is formed by erosional scour or localized non-deposition within a carbonate succession.

diagenetic alteration,"A diagenetic alteration is a post-depositional process that modifies the mineralogy, fabric, and petrophysical properties of a sedimentary rock, fundamentally controlling the quality of carbonate reservoirs in the Brazilian Pre-Salt. These modifications, primarily dissolution and cementation, are the principal controls on the creation, preservation, or destruction of the reservoir's porosity and permeability. The resulting rock fabric dictates the storage capacity and fluid-flow pathways within these complex geological systems."
evaporite sequence,"An evaporite sequence is a thick and laterally extensive lithostratigraphic succession that is predominantly composed of halite with associated anhydrite and other saline minerals. In the context of the Brazilian continental margin, this Aptian-age sequence constitutes the regional top seal for the underlying Pre-Salt petroleum system. Its rheological properties promote significant halokinesis, which profoundly influences the structural and stratigraphic framework of the overlying post-salt section."
extensional fault,"An extensional fault is a brittle deformation structure that accommodates crustal stretching, characterized by the downward displacement of the hanging wall relative to the footwall. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these faults formed the fundamental horst and graben architecture during the South Atlantic rifting phase. This inherited paleotopography was the primary control on the deposition of microbial carbonate reservoirs and the formation of structural traps."
gas,"Gas is a phase of petroleum that is composed predominantly of methane and other light hydrocarbons and exists in a gaseous state at reservoir conditions. Generated from the thermal cracking of lacustrine organic matter, this fluid often contains high concentrations of carbon dioxide and accumulates in carbonate reservoirs as a free gas cap or a non-associated accumulation."
lateral continuity,"Lateral continuity is a geological property that describes the spatial extent over which a specific depositional facies or reservoir rock type, such as a Pre-Salt microbialite or coquina body, maintains predictable lithological and petrophysical attributes. This property is a critical parameter for assessing reservoir connectivity and estimating hydrocarbon volumes in place. The predictability of this extent is fundamentally controlled by the depositional environment and subsequent diagenetic overprint."
mg-clay,"An mg-clay is a group of authigenic magnesium-rich phyllosilicate minerals, primarily stevensite and kerolite, that forms via direct precipitation in the alkaline and silica-rich lacustrine environments of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. These clays are a key component of the source rock and non-reservoir intervals, significantly influencing diagenetic pathways and reservoir quality."
resistivity log,"A resistivity log is a geophysical well log that continuously records the electrical resistivity of formations penetrated by a borehole.

In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine carbonates, these variations reflect changes in water chemistry, biological activity, and sediment supply that control the deposition of microbialites, coquinas, and siliciclastics. This layering is a fundamental control on the distribution of reservoir facies and the resulting petrophysical heterogeneity."
sylvite,Sylvite is an evaporite mineral of potassium chloride (KCl) that is a key constituent of the Aptian salt succession in the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its distinct rheology and higher solubility compared to halite create zones of mechanical weakness that can compromise the integrity and sealing capacity of the regional evaporite layer. The presence and distribution of sylvite are therefore critical controls on both seal risk and drilling hazards.
syn-rift,"Syn-rift is a tectono-stratigraphic phase that is characterized by deposition contemporaneous with the active crustal extension that formed the precursor basins of the South Atlantic. This phase is defined by active normal faulting, which created the half-graben architecture controlling the initial deposition of continental clastic and volcanic sequences. The resulting structural framework and elevated heat flow are fundamental to the subsequent development of the Pre-Salt petroleum system."

In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this elevated paleo-topography creates a focal point for the deposition of high-energy microbialite and coquina carbonate reservoirs. It simultaneously forms the core of a major structural trap for hydrocarbons generated in the adjacent syn-rift source kitchens."
groundwater,"Groundwater is the subsurface aqueous fluid that saturates the pore system of a geological formation. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, it is the formation water, typically a hypersaline brine, that coexists with hydrocarbons and critically influences diagenetic pathways in the carbonate reservoirs. This water's complex composition reflects a mixture of meteoric, connate, and hydrothermal sources related to the basin's tectono-stratigraphic evolution."
growth phase,"A growth phase is a tectonic stage within the post-rift succession that is characterized by the active, gravity-driven movement of Aptian salt structures. This halokinesis deforms the overlying strata, creating accommodation space and forming structural closures. The timing and intensity of this phase are critical controls on the development of post-salt traps and reservoirs."
half-graben system,"A half-graben system is a structural framework of asymmetric depocenters that develops during continental rifting, where each depocenter is controlled by a master normal fault and an opposing hinged margin. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this framework creates the deep lacustrine settings for source rock deposition within the graben axis. It also forms the adjacent structural highs that are the preferential sites for the development of microbial carbonate reservoirs."
lake water chemistry,"Lake water chemistry is the set of geochemical properties of a lacustrine water body that, within the Brazilian Pre-Salt sag basins, fundamentally controlled the precipitation of non-skeletal carbonates and their subsequent diagenesis. Key parameters, including salinity, alkalinity, and the Mg/Ca ratio, dictated the formation of unique reservoir facies such as spherulites and microbialites. This chemical control is therefore a primary determinant of the distribution and quality of the petroleum reservoir."
late jurassic,"The Late Jurassic is a geologic epoch that concludes the Jurassic Period and represents the pre-rift, continental phase prior to the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this epoch is characterized by the deposition of widespread desert systems, including eolian and fluvial sandstones. These successions form the economic basement to the main Pre-Salt petroleum system, underlying the lacustrine source rocks and carbonate reservoirs."
marine incursion,"A marine incursion is a transgressive geological event that floods a previously non-marine or restricted basin with oceanic water, fundamentally altering its hydrochemistry and depositional systems. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this event marks the pivotal transition from the Barremian lacustrine sag phase to the Aptian saline giant environment. This shift terminated the deposition of key lacustrine source rocks and initiated the precipitation of the regional salt seal, which is critical to the petroleum system."
mechanical compaction,"Mechanical compaction is a physical diagenetic process that reduces the bulk volume and porosity of sediments under increasing effective stress from overburden. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates, this process is manifested by the rearrangement and fracturing of bioclasts in coquinas or the crushing of delicate fabrics in microbialites. This porosity loss occurs primarily through physical mechanisms, distinguishing it from chemical compaction processes such as pressure solution."
microfacies,"A microfacies is a distinct assemblage of petrographic characteristics, including constituent grains, matrix, cement, and fabric, that is observed in thin section and reflects a specific depositional environment and its subsequent diagenetic history. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, microfacies analysis is fundamental for characterizing the complex interplay between depositional textures, such as microbial frameworks and coquinas, and the diagenetic processes that ultimately control reservoir quality. This characterization allows for the definition of rock types used in geological modeling."
nodule,"A nodule is a discrete diagenetic body that forms as a subspherical to irregular mass of contrasting mineral composition, most commonly chert or anhydrite, embedded within the host Pre-Salt carbonate rock. This feature originates from post-depositional processes, such as replacement or precipitation, and often reduces local reservoir quality by occluding primary porosity."
organic acid,"An organic acid is a diagenetic agent that is derived from the thermal maturation of lacustrine kerogen within the Pre-Salt source rocks. It is a key component of pore fluids responsible for the dissolution of carbonate minerals, such as calcite and dolomite. This process is critical for creating and enhancing secondary porosity in microbialite and coquina reservoirs."
planar lamination,"Planar lamination is a primary sedimentary structure that is composed of parallel, sub-horizontal laminae, each typically less than one centimeter thick. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine systems, it commonly forms from the settling of fine-grained carbonate from suspension in anoxic bottom waters or through the tractional alignment of platy bioclasts. This structure is a key indicator of low-energy depositional environments and can be associated with intervals of high source rock potential."
pre-rift,"Pre-rift is a tectono-stratigraphic megasequence that comprises the package of sedimentary and volcanic rocks deposited on the Gondwanan basement prior to the main extensional faulting phase associated with the South Atlantic opening. This succession is typically composed of Paleozoic siliciclastic deposits and Mesozoic desertic sequences, including extensive flood basalts of the Paraná-Etendeka province. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this unit constitutes the economic basement upon which the syn-rift source rocks and subsequent carbonate reservoirs were deposited."
pre-salt structure,"A pre-salt structure is a structural high that formed within the syn-rift to sag sedimentary succession of the South Atlantic passive margin. This feature is stratigraphically positioned beneath the regional Aptian evaporite sequence, which provides the essential top seal for hydrocarbon accumulations. Commonly manifested as horsts or tilted fault blocks, these structures host the prolific carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system."
redeposited,"Redeposited is an attribute of a carbonate deposit whose constituent clasts, such as microbialite spherulites or coquina fragments, have been eroded from a high-energy setting and transported by gravity flows to accumulate as a distinct facies in a lower-energy part of the basin. These grain-supported deposits, often forming grainstones and rudstones, constitute the most significant reservoir intervals in the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
sag basin,"A sag basin is a broad tectonic-stratigraphic unit that develops during the post-rift stage of basin evolution, characterized by regional, long-wavelength subsidence driven primarily by thermal cooling and contraction of the lithosphere. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this phase initiates with the deposition of the Aptian salt, which acts as a regional seal, and continues with the accumulation of the thick post-salt carbonate and clastic successions. The substantial sedimentary load of the sag sequence is a critical factor for driving the maturation of the underlying lacustrine source rocks and for triggering the halokinesis that creates structural traps for the microbialite reservoirs."
sidewall sample,"A sidewall sample is a discrete rock sample that is mechanically extracted from the wall of a borehole using a wireline-conveyed tool. It provides crucial ground-truth data at specific depths, selected based on well log responses, for direct petrophysical and geological analysis. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these samples are vital for characterizing the complex textures of carbonate reservoirs and calibrating formation evaluation models used to estimate porosity and permeability."
subsurface,"The subsurface is a volume of the Earth's crust that extends downwards from a reference surface, such as the seafloor, and contains all geological materials, fluids, and structures. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this volume is the domain of petroleum systems investigation, encompassing the post-salt, salt, and pre-salt megasequences. It is characterized and modeled using geophysical data, well logs, and rock samples."
sweeping extinction,"Sweeping extinction is an optical phenomenon in anisotropic minerals that is characterized by a wave of darkness moving across a crystal during stage rotation under cross-polarized light. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is a key diagenetic feature in calcite spherulites and cements, indicating plastic deformation of the crystal lattice. This deformation is typically induced by stresses related to burial compaction or salt tectonics, impacting reservoir rock properties."
volcanic clast,"A volcanic clast is a lithoclast that is composed of igneous material derived from the fragmentation of volcanic rocks. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these clasts typically originate from syn-rift basalts and trachytes and can be reworked into the carbonate depositional system. Their presence within reservoir facies, such as coquinas or microbialites, can significantly influence local diagenetic pathways and reservoir quality."
anticline,"An anticline is a fold-related structural trap that is convex upward with stratigraphically older rocks in its core. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt province, these features are typically large, low-relief, four-way dip closures that host significant hydrocarbon accumulations in sag-phase microbial carbonate reservoirs. The structural integrity and sealing capacity of these anticlines are critically dependent on the overlying Aptian evaporite sequence."
asthenospheric uplift,"Asthenospheric uplift is a geodynamic process that involves the upward movement of hot, buoyant mantle material, which causes thermal doming, lithospheric thinning, and crustal extension. In the context of the South Atlantic, this mechanism is the primary driver for the continental rifting that formed the precursor basins to the Brazilian Pre-Salt province. The associated high heat flow is a critical element for the maturation of the lacustrine source rocks within the Pre-Salt petroleum system."
basin evolution,"Basin evolution is a geodynamic process that describes the integrated tectonic, sedimentary, and thermal history of a basin through its rift, sag, and drift phases. This tectono-stratigraphic framework governs the formation, architecture, and temporal development of all petroleum system elements. It specifically controls the deposition of pre-salt source rocks and microbial carbonate reservoirs, their burial history, and the ultimate timing of hydrocarbon generation and accumulation."
bivalve rudstone,"A bivalve rudstone is a grain-supported carbonate rock that is composed of a framework of bivalve shells and fragments deposited in high-energy, shallow lacustrine settings, forming a key Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoir facies. Its excellent reservoir quality results from significant secondary porosity generated by the diagenetic dissolution of the shells, creating an effective moldic and vuggy pore system."
carbonate sequence,"A carbonate sequence is a depositional sequence that is predominantly composed of genetically related carbonate strata bounded by unconformities or their correlative conformities. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these sequences are characterized by thick successions of lacustrine microbialites and spherulites deposited during the sag phase of continental rifting. These stratigraphic packages form the primary reservoir intervals, with their internal architecture and quality controlled by high-frequency cycles of lake-level fluctuation."
continental flood basalt,"A continental flood basalt is an extensive succession of subaerially erupted, mafic volcanic rocks that covers vast areas of a continent and is associated with mantle plume activity during continental rifting. In the Brazilian Santos and Campos basins, this succession forms the Aptian-age economic basement whose emplacement and subsequent cooling critically influenced the thermal maturation of the overlying Pre-Salt source rocks. The weathered and fractured top of these basalts can occasionally constitute a secondary reservoir target."
discontinuity,"A discontinuity is a planar or curviplanar surface within a rock mass that represents a mechanical, stratigraphic, or diagenetic break in the continuity of geological properties. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these features most commonly manifest as faults, fracture corridors, unconformities, and stylolitic seams. Such surfaces critically control the geometry, compartmentalization, and fluid flow properties of the carbonate reservoirs."
exploratory well,"An exploratory well is a petroleum well that is drilled to test an unproven geological prospect and discover a new hydrocarbon accumulation. It is the first well drilled in a frontier area or new play to confirm the presence of a viable petroleum system, such as the pioneering wells that targeted the microbial carbonate reservoirs beneath the salt layer in Brazil. This type of well is characterized by the highest geological uncertainty and financial risk, as its primary goal is to acquire critical subsurface data to de-risk a potential discovery."
fault plane,"A fault plane is a planar discontinuity that represents the surface of shear displacement between two adjacent rock blocks. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, these are typically listric normal faults formed during the syn-rift phase, defining the geometry of half-grabens where source and reservoir rocks were deposited. The sealing or conductive nature of this surface, often through juxtaposition against Aptian salt or other non-reservoir units, is a critical element controlling hydrocarbon migration and trap formation."
fault zone,"A fault zone is a tabular volume of rock that accommodates significant shear displacement through a system of interconnected faults and associated fractures. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these zones are predominantly rift-related normal faults that define the horst and graben structures forming the primary hydrocarbon traps. They critically influence the petroleum system by acting as conduits for hydrocarbon migration from source to reservoir, creating permeability anisotropy, and forming barriers that result in reservoir compartmentalization."
fine-grained carbonate,"A fine-grained carbonate is a carbonate sedimentary rock that is composed predominantly of particles smaller than 62.5 micrometers, including micrite and microbially-mediated precipitates like spherulites. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these rocks form the principal reservoir facies within a unique lacustrine depositional system. Their reservoir quality is controlled by a complex interplay between primary interparticle porosity and extensive diagenetic modification, such as dissolution."
fold,"A fold is a geological structure that results from the ductile bending of originally planar rock surfaces, such as sedimentary layers. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt province, these features are predominantly gentle, large-wavelength structures formed by salt movement or draping over basement topography. Their crestal culminations create the structural closures essential for trapping vast hydrocarbon accumulations in the carbonate reservoirs."
frequency,"Frequency is a fundamental seismic attribute that quantifies the rate of oscillation of a seismic wave, directly governing the vertical resolution for imaging geological features. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, its analysis is critical for delineating the complex internal architecture of carbonate reservoirs. Spectral decomposition and other frequency-based analyses are employed to distinguish reservoir facies, such as microbialites and coquinas, and to identify fluid-related anomalies."
horizon,"A horizon is an interpreted surface on seismic data that corresponds to a continuous reflection generated by a contrast in acoustic impedance between adjacent rock layers. This surface is used to map the three-dimensional geometry of key petroleum system elements, such as the base of the salt layer or the top of the pre-salt carbonate reservoirs. It represents a geological boundary or a chronostratigraphically significant event."
isopach map,"An isopach map is a contour map that illustrates the true stratigraphic thickness of a geological unit. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is a critical tool used to delineate the geometry of lacustrine carbonate reservoirs and to quantify gross rock volume for volumetric estimations. The map is constructed by contouring thickness values measured perpendicular to bedding planes, which are derived from the integrated interpretation of seismic and well log data."
lithospheric stretching,"Lithospheric stretching is a geodynamic process that results from extensional tectonic forces causing the horizontal extension and vertical thinning of the continental lithosphere. This process leads to the formation of rift basins through crustal faulting and thermally-driven subsidence. In the South Atlantic, this mechanism was fundamental for creating the accommodation space and high heat flow regime necessary for the deposition and preservation of the Pre-Salt lacustrine source rocks and carbonate reservoirs."
mineralogical composition,"Mineralogical composition is a fundamental property of a geological material that defines the identity and relative abundance of its constituent mineral phases. In Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, this property primarily quantifies the proportions of depositional carbonates, authigenic magnesium-silicate clays, and associated evaporitic minerals. This assemblage is a primary control on the rock's petrophysical and geomechanical behavior, directly impacting reservoir quality."
pre-salt succession,A pre-salt succession is a tectono-stratigraphic sequence of Late Barremian to Early Aptian age that encompasses the primary source rocks and microbial-bioclastic carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system. It was deposited in a lacustrine to transitional marine environment during the late-rift to sag phases of the South Atlantic opening. This succession is stratigraphically confined between the base of the Aptian salt layer above and a regional unconformity below.
prograding geometry,"A prograding geometry is a stratigraphic pattern that results from the lateral, basinward outbuilding of a depositional system when the rate of sediment accumulation exceeds the rate of accommodation creation. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this geometry is characterized by inclined clinoforms of high-energy carbonates, such as coquinas or microbialites, that downlap onto lacustrine source rocks and form the main reservoir bodies."
salt structure,"A salt structure is a subsurface geological body that is composed of mobile evaporitic rocks, primarily halite, and results from the deformation of a mother salt layer due to halokinesis. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these allochthonous or autochthonous bodies form the primary regional seal and create the structural closures for the underlying carbonate reservoirs. The high thermal conductivity of these structures also critically influences the thermal maturation history of the Aptian source rocks and the heat flow into the post-salt section."
seismic response,"A seismic response is a geophysical representation of the subsurface that is generated by the reflection of seismic waves at interfaces with contrasting acoustic impedance. These impedance contrasts are primarily driven by variations in lithology, porosity, and fluid content. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is the fundamental data used to interpret the complex architecture of carbonate reservoirs and to differentiate between hydrocarbon and CO2 accumulations."
seismic unit,"A seismic unit is a mappable seismo-stratigraphic entity that is bounded by seismic reflectors interpreted as chronostratigraphic surfaces and is characterized by a distinct internal seismic facies. This entity is inferred to correspond to a package of genetically related strata, such as the microbialite or coquina reservoir intervals within the sag phase of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
stratigraphic sequence,"A stratigraphic sequence is a fundamental stratigraphic unit that comprises a genetically related succession of strata deposited during a single cycle of relative base-level change in a rift setting. It is bounded by unconformities or their correlative conformities, which in the Brazilian Pre-Salt often represent surfaces of subaerial exposure, tectonic erosion, or major lacustrine flooding. The internal architecture of these sequences governs the primary distribution and quality of lacustrine carbonate reservoirs and associated source and seal facies."
structural domain,"A structural domain is a major crustal region of a rifted margin that is characterized by a distinct structural framework and tectonic history, typically bounded by reactivated basement fault systems. This framework directly controls the rift architecture, the depositional fairways of pre-salt source rocks and microbial carbonate reservoirs, and the subsequent evolution of the salt layer."
syncline,"A syncline is a structural fold that is concave-upward and contains the youngest rock strata in its core. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, synclines in the overburden, often formed by salt withdrawal, act as critical depocenters for clastic reservoirs and focus hydrocarbon migration from underlying source rocks."
transgression,"A transgression is a geological process of relative base-level rise that causes the landward migration of a coastline. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process causes the retrogradation of depositional systems, often terminating the growth of lacustrine carbonate reservoirs and resulting in a stratigraphic succession where deeper-water facies overlie shallower-water facies."
abiotic origin,"An abiotic origin is a genesis of a geological material or fluid component that results from inorganic physicochemical processes, independent of the direct metabolic activity of organisms. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this term primarily describes the precipitation of carbonate reservoir facies from supersaturated lacustrine brines and the contribution of mantle-derived gases, such as CO2, to the petroleum system."
biofilm,"A biofilm is a matrix-enclosed microbial community that adheres to a substrate and mediates carbonate biomineralization by trapping and binding particles. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine setting, these biofilms constitute the fundamental organic framework for the growth of microbialite buildups. Their metabolic activity is a primary control on the development of high-porosity reservoir facies."
clotted texture,"A clotted texture is a primary to early diagenetic carbonate fabric that is defined by a framework of poorly sorted, mesoscopic aggregates of microcrystalline calcite or aragonite. These aggregates, often termed mesoclots, are typically of microbial or organo-mineral origin and are separated by inter-clot porosity or cement. This fabric is characteristic of the thrombolitic facies found in Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs."
fan delta,"A fan delta is a clastic depositional system that is formed by the direct progradation of a coarse-grained alluvial fan into a standing body of water, typically a lake within a tectonically active rift basin. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these systems constitute significant clastic reservoirs sourced from uplifted rift shoulders, often interfingering with lacustrine source rocks and carbonate buildups."
gel,A gel is a magnesium silicate hydrate protolith that precipitated from alkaline lacustrine waters and subsequently transformed through diagenesis into the unique carbonate reservoir rocks of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. This largely amorphous precursor material is considered the primary substance that generated the complex microbial and abiotic reservoir facies.
petroleum province,"A petroleum province is a large-scale geological region that encompasses a sedimentary basin or a group of genetically related basins sharing a common tectono-sedimentary history. This shared geological framework governs the formation of one or more petroleum systems, resulting in a collection of fields and accumulations with similar origins and characteristics. The Santos Basin, which hosts the extensive lacustrine source-to-carbonate reservoir system of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, is a prime example of such a province."
platform top,"A platform top is a regional stratigraphic surface that marks the cessation of shallow-water carbonate deposition at the end of the sag phase in Brazilian Pre-Salt basins. This surface represents a key seismic marker that separates the Aptian carbonate reservoir succession, such as the Barra Velha Formation, from the overlying evaporitic sequence. It often corresponds to a major unconformity or a terminal drowning surface, signifying a basin-wide change in depositional conditions."
reef,"A reef is an in-situ carbonate buildup that possesses a rigid organic framework and topographic relief, capable of resisting wave action. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, these buildups are typically microbial-dominated bioconstructions of Aptian age that form highly porous and permeable reservoir intervals."
sepiolite,"Sepiolite is an authigenic clay mineral that precipitates directly from the alkaline, magnesium- and silicon-rich lacustrine waters characteristic of the Brazilian Pre-Salt sag phase. It is commonly found as fibrous crystals infilling pores and replacing grains within Aptian microbial carbonate facies. This occurrence significantly degrades reservoir quality by creating extensive microporosity that hosts irreducible water and occludes pore throats, thereby reducing permeability."
shallow marine environment,"A shallow marine environment is a depositional environment that is situated on a continental shelf or carbonate platform within the photic zone and above storm wave base, where sedimentation is controlled by wave, tide, and current activity. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these environments are primarily associated with the post-salt carbonate platform successions which form important secondary reservoirs and regional seals."
silt,"Silt is a clastic sediment that is defined by a particle size intermediate between sand and clay, ranging from 4 to 62.5 micrometers. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt lacustrine carbonate system, these fine-grained siliciclastic or detrital carbonate deposits form low-permeability layers that act as baffles to fluid flow. Such layers can significantly impact reservoir connectivity and compartmentalization."
alteration,"Alteration is any post-depositional process that modifies the mineralogical composition, texture, or fabric of a rock. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these processes, chiefly diagenesis and hydrothermalism, are the fundamental controls on the creation, destruction, and redistribution of porosity and permeability in carbonate reservoirs."
bioclastic rudstone,"A bioclastic rudstone is a grain-supported carbonate rock that is defined by a framework of bioclasts larger than 2 mm, predominantly composed of fragmented bivalve and gastropod shells. Deposited under high-energy lacustrine conditions, this facies constitutes a primary reservoir target in the Brazilian Pre-Salt due to its characteristically high primary interparticle porosity."
calcite shrub,"A calcite shrub is a carbonate crystal fabric that exhibits a branching, dendritic morphology formed by aggregates of calcite spherulites.

It is a primary control on the distribution and connectivity of petroleum system elements."
extensional basin,"An extensional basin is a structural basin that is formed by the stretching and thinning of the lithosphere in response to divergent tectonic forces. This process creates accommodation space through subsidence and is characterized by normal faulting, which develops the horst-and-graben framework essential for the deposition of the source rocks and reservoirs of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
fault pattern,"A fault pattern is a structural configuration defined by the spatial arrangement, orientation, and connectivity of a set of genetically related faults. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this configuration is predominantly a system of normal faults inherited from the South Atlantic rift phase, creating the horst-and-graben topography essential for the deposition of both lacustrine source rocks and carbonate reservoirs. This primary rift fabric is frequently modified by subsequent halokinesis, impacting final trap geometry and hydrocarbon migration pathways."
footwall,"A footwall is a fault block that lies structurally beneath an inclined fault plane. In the extensional tectonic regime of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, the footwall represents the relatively uplifted block that forms structural highs, such as horsts and tilted blocks. These structural culminations are critical exploration targets as they commonly host the main microbialite and coquina carbonate reservoirs."
geometry,"Geometry is a set of three-dimensional attributes that defines the external shape, internal architecture, and spatial arrangement of a rock body. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it specifically characterizes the form of lacustrine carbonate reservoirs, the configuration of structural traps beneath the salt, and the complex morphology of the overlying evaporite sequence. The accurate definition of these geometries is fundamental for seismic interpretation and the calculation of in-place hydrocarbon volumes."
internal reflector,"An internal reflector is a mappable seismic interface that represents a surface of significant acoustic impedance contrast occurring within the boundaries of a larger, genetically related stratigraphic unit. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs, these reflectors often correspond to geological features such as diagenetic fronts, layers of volcanic rock, or fine-grained siliciclastic deposits interbedded within the main reservoir succession. The characterization of these surfaces is critical as they can act as significant baffles or barriers to fluid flow, controlling reservoir compartmentalization."
lineament,"A lineament is a mappable linear or curvilinear feature, identified on geophysical data, that represents the expression of an underlying geological discontinuity. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it typically corresponds to a basement-involved fault system or shear zone that was reactivated during the South Atlantic rifting phase. Such features are fundamental to exploration as they control the rift architecture, the location of structural highs, and the fracture patterns within the carbonate reservoirs."
lithostratigraphy,"Lithostratigraphy is the sub-discipline of stratigraphy that organizes sedimentary rock successions into mappable units based on their distinct physical and petrographic characteristics, independent of their inferred geologic age or mode of origin. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this framework is essential for correlating genetically distinct carbonate reservoir bodies, such as the microbialite and coquina facies within the Barra Velha Formation, across a basin. This correlation provides the fundamental geometric architecture for building static reservoir models."
neoproterozoic,"Neoproterozoic is a geologic era of the Proterozoic Eon that spans from 1000 to 541 million years ago. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt province, this term refers to the metamorphic and igneous crystalline basement complex formed during the Brasiliano-Pan-African orogeny. The structural fabric and paleotopography of this basement exerted a primary control on the location and evolution of the Mesozoic rift basins that contain the Pre-Salt petroleum systems."
oceanic anoxic event,"An oceanic anoxic event is a geologically brief interval of widespread marine anoxia that is recorded in the stratigraphic record by the deposition of organic-rich sediments. These episodes are linked to major perturbations in the global carbon cycle and are fundamental to the formation of prolific petroleum source rocks. In the context of the Brazilian margin, they are responsible for the world-class source rocks deposited during the Aptian sag phase."
precambrian basement,"A Precambrian basement is a crustal complex of predominantly igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks that underlies the Phanerozoic sedimentary successions of the Brazilian continental margin. Within the Pre-Salt petroleum system, this complex acts as the economic and structural floor, with its paleotopography controlling the initial deposition of rift-phase source and reservoir rocks. It is generally considered non-productive, although its weathered and fractured top may occasionally possess secondary reservoir potential."
reworked deposit,"A reworked deposit is a carbonate sedimentary body that is constituted by clasts, such as spherulites, bioclasts, or intraclasts, which were eroded from a primary depositional site and subsequently redeposited by high-energy lacustrine processes. This reworking typically winnows out the fine-grained matrix, resulting in well-sorted facies with enhanced porosity and permeability. Such deposits form prolific reservoir intervals in the Brazilian Pre-Salt, commonly occurring as grainstone shoals on structural highs or along lake margins."
shallow marine setting,"A shallow marine setting is a depositional environment characterized by seawater of normal salinity, located on a continental shelf or carbonate platform at depths typically within the photic zone. Within the petroleum system of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this setting is exemplified by the post-salt Albian-Cenomanian carbonates that form the critical regional seal above the Aptian salt and lacustrine reservoirs."
shoreface,"A shoreface is a depositional environment that is situated along the margin of the Pre-Salt lacustrine system, extending from the fair-weather wave base to the low-water mark. It is characterized by high hydrodynamic energy that reworks and sorts carbonate sediments, forming high-quality reservoirs such as coquinas and grainstones."
stacking pattern,"A stacking pattern is a stratigraphic architecture that describes the vertical succession of genetically related depositional units, such as facies or parasequences. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this architecture is primarily controlled by the interplay between accommodation and sediment supply in a lacustrine setting, reflecting climatic and tectonic-driven lake-level fluctuations. It governs the three-dimensional distribution and connectivity of reservoir facies, such as microbialites and coquinas, making it a critical concept for reservoir characterization and modeling."
supersequence,"A supersequence is a first-order tectono-stratigraphic unit that comprises a succession of genetically related depositional sequences bounded by regionally extensive unconformities. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these units represent the principal phases of Aptian sag basin evolution, driven by major tectonic and climatic shifts. They typically encompass the key elements of the lacustrine petroleum system, including source, reservoir, and regional seal intervals."
tectonic quiescence,"Tectonic quiescence is a post-rift geological interval that is characterized by a minimal rate of crustal deformation and is dominated by slow, regional thermal subsidence. This stage creates the stable, low-gradient accommodation space essential for the widespread development of the Brazilian Pre-Salt's lacustrine carbonate reservoir systems. It represents the critical period of basin stability between the active syn-rift faulting phase and the onset of major salt deposition and halokinesis."
tectonic regime,"A tectonic regime is a geodynamic setting that is defined by the dominant type and orientation of crustal stresses and the resulting style of geological deformation over a specific geological time interval. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, the evolution from an extensional rift regime to a post-rift thermal sag regime fundamentally controlled the creation of accommodation space, depositional architecture, and the primary structural framework of the petroleum system. These regimes directly influenced the deposition of both lacustrine source rocks and the subsequent extensive carbonate reservoir systems."
tectono-stratigraphy,"Tectono-stratigraphy is a geological subdiscipline that defines large-scale stratigraphic units based on their genetic relationship to the tectonic evolution of a sedimentary basin. This framework is fundamental in the Brazilian Pre-Salt for differentiating the syn-rift successions, deposited in active grabens, from the overlying sag phase successions which host the regional microbial carbonate reservoirs. The resulting architecture, including the sealing Aptian salt, is the primary control on the distribution and geometry of the pre-salt petroleum system elements."
volcaniclastic,"A volcaniclastic rock is a type of clastic rock that is composed predominantly of fragments derived from volcanic activity. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these deposits are typically mafic syn-rift successions interbedded with lacustrine carbonates of the sag phase. They critically influence the petroleum system by acting as seals, affecting reservoir diagenesis, or constituting potential unconventional reservoirs."
angular unconformity,"An angular unconformity is an unconformity that separates younger, relatively horizontal strata from older, underlying strata which were tilted, folded, and truncated by erosion prior to the deposition of the overlying sequence. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this feature is exemplified by the regional Break-up Unconformity, which separates the tilted syn-rift fault blocks from the overlying post-rift sag basin deposits containing the main carbonate reservoirs. This surface is a fundamental element of the petroleum system, often forming the upper seal for syn-rift traps or acting as a migration surface for hydrocarbons into the post-rift succession."
antecedent topography,"Antecedent topography is a paleorelief of the pre-carbonate substrate that controlled the initial establishment and subsequent development of carbonate depositional systems. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this surface is typically formed on syn-rift volcanic and siliciclastic rocks. Its structural and geomorphological highs provided the preferential sites for the accumulation of high-quality microbialite and coquina reservoirs."
lacustrine carbonate system,"A lacustrine carbonate system is a depositional system that develops within large, saline to hypersaline lakes of continental rift settings, characterized by carbonate production dominated by microbial mediation and direct chemical precipitation. It generates unique facies, such as microbially-influenced spherulites and abiotic calcite shrubs, often interbedded with bioclastic accumulations like coquinas. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these systems form world-class petroleum reservoirs due to the development and preservation of exceptional porosity and permeability."
reflector termination,"A reflector termination is a seismic stratigraphic feature that represents the lateral end of a stratal surface, as imaged by a seismic reflector, where it abuts another surface of depositional or erosional origin. These geometric relationships, classified as onlap, downlap, or truncation, are fundamental for interpreting depositional sequences and unconformities. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, their analysis is critical for delineating the complex geometries of microbialite and coquina carbonate reservoirs and identifying key sequence boundaries within the rift and sag sections."
reworked spherulite,"A reworked spherulite is a carbonate clast that is formed by the erosion, transport, and subsequent redeposition of a primary, in-situ spherulite within the Pre-Salt lacustrine depositional system. These grains are fundamental components of high-energy, grain-supported facies that often constitute high-quality petroleum reservoirs. The process of reworking can modify the grain's original texture through abrasion and sorting, enhancing interparticle porosity."
sequence-stratigraphic architecture,"Sequence-stratigraphic architecture is a geometrical framework that describes the three-dimensional arrangement of depositional sequences and their component systems tracts, as defined by key stratigraphic surfaces. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this architecture is primarily controlled by the interplay between tectonically-driven accommodation in a rift setting and high-frequency, climatically-induced lake-level fluctuations.

Their presence often indicates periods of nutrient-rich, anoxic bottom waters and can significantly impact reservoir rock fabric and porosity evolution."
pressure dissolution,"Pressure dissolution is a diagenetic process of chemical compaction that occurs in deeply buried carbonate successions, where effective stress at grain contacts selectively increases mineral solubility. This mass-transfer mechanism drives the dissolution of calcite and dolomite at stressed interfaces and their subsequent precipitation as cement in adjacent, lower-stress pore spaces. The process is a primary control on reservoir quality destruction, creating stylolites and solution seams that significantly reduce porosity and permeability."
primary constituent,"A primary constituent is a textural component that formed at or near the time of deposition and defines the original fabric of a sedimentary rock, such as the microbial spherulites and bivalve shells that form the framework of Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonates.

bioturbated,"Bioturbated is a textural attribute of a sedimentary rock that describes the disruption of primary depositional fabrics by the burrowing, feeding, or dwelling activities of organisms. In the lacustrine carbonates of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process commonly results in a mottled fabric that alters the original porosity and permeability network. The intensity of bioturbation can range from discrete burrows to a completely homogenized sediment, significantly impacting reservoir quality."
brecciation,"Brecciation is a geological process that fragments a pre-existing rock into angular clasts that are subsequently lithified within a matrix or by cement. In Brazilian Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs, it is a critical mechanism for reservoir creation, typically resulting from the dissolution and gravitational collapse of soluble evaporite or carbonate layers. Hydrothermal fluid flow can also induce brecciation, with the resulting textures significantly enhancing reservoir porosity and permeability."
coated grain,"A coated grain is a composite carbonate particle that consists of a central nucleus enveloped by a cortex of concentric or irregular laminae. In the lacustrine depositional systems of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this cortex is typically formed by microbial mediation or direct chemical precipitation from alkaline waters, creating fundamental grain types like oncoids and spherulites. These grains are critical constituents of high-energy shoal and shoreline reservoir facies."
collapse,"Collapse is a diagenetic and gravitational process that results from the failure and downward movement of overlying rock strata due to the dissolution of soluble carbonate or evaporitic layers during subaerial exposure. This process is fundamental to the formation of Pre-Salt reservoirs, creating chaotic breccias and sag structures whose reservoir quality is controlled by the resulting clast fabric and matrix properties."
colluvial wedge,"A colluvial wedge is a sedimentary body that is formed by the gravity-driven accumulation of poorly sorted clastic material into a wedge-shaped geometry at the base of a fault-bounded paleotopographic high.

rounded,"Rounded is a textural attribute that characterizes carbonate grains, such as ooids or reworked intraclasts, whose original angularities have been removed by mechanical abrasion or which formed through accretionary growth in high-energy depositional environments. This attribute is a key indicator of depositional conditions that favor the development of high-quality reservoir facies within the Brazilian Pre-Salt. In these settings, facies composed of rounded grains typically form grain-supported fabrics with high primary interparticle porosity and permeability."
saline lacustrine environment,"A saline lacustrine environment is a continental depositional system that is characterized by a restricted, tectonically-controlled lake where evaporation exceeds inflow, leading to alkaline, hypersaline waters. This specific hydrochemistry, influenced by the weathering of surrounding volcanic rocks, is responsible for the precipitation of the unique microbial and abiotic carbonates forming the Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs. The system is also favorable for the deposition of organic-rich source rocks."
sedimentary infill,"A sedimentary infill is a succession of strata that progressively fills a pre-existing accommodation space created by tectonic subsidence or erosion. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this term typically refers to the lacustrine carbonate and clastic deposits that accumulated within rift-related grabens and the subsequent sag basin. These successions constitute the primary source and reservoir intervals of the petroleum system."
silica layer,"A silica layer is a diagenetic rock interval that is composed predominantly of authigenic silica, typically as chert. It is formed by the in-situ alteration of magnesium-silicate precursors within the lacustrine carbonate succession of the Barra Velha Formation. This low-permeability lithofacies acts as a critical vertical flow barrier, compartmentalizing the main reservoir bodies."
silicified,"A silicified rock is a rock that has undergone a diagenetic process where silica minerals, such as quartz or chalcedony, replace pre-existing minerals or precipitate as cement within pore spaces. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this alteration predominantly affects lacustrine carbonate facies, particularly microbialites, by replacing the original calcite or dolomite framework. This process critically controls reservoir quality by generally occluding the pore system and reducing permeability, though it can occasionally enhance rock strength to preserve porosity during burial."
spherulite grainstone,A spherulite grainstone is a grain-supported lacustrine carbonate rock that is composed predominantly of abiotically precipitated calcite spherulites as framework grains and lacks a micritic matrix. This facies forms extensive high-energy shoal deposits within the Aptian section of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. It constitutes a primary reservoir target due to its characteristically high primary interparticle porosity and permeability.
spherulitic shrubstone,"A spherulitic shrubstone is a microbial boundstone that is characterized by a rigid, in-situ framework of dendritic, shrub-like bodies. This framework is constructed from coalesced, radially fibrous calcite spherulites, which are interpreted as products of microbially mediated precipitation within the unique alkaline lacustrine systems of the South Atlantic rift. This lithofacies constitutes the primary high-quality reservoir rock in the Aptian sag section of the Brazilian Pre-Salt."
super-sequence,"A super-sequence is a high-order tectono-stratigraphic unit that comprises a succession of genetically related depositional sequences and is bounded at its top and base by major, tectonically-enhanced unconformities.

vuggy pore,"A vuggy pore is a secondary pore that is larger than the rock's constituent particles and is formed by the non-fabric selective dissolution of minerals. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these pores are commonly generated by diagenetic processes affecting microbial and spherulitic carbonate facies, significantly enhancing reservoir storage capacity. Their contribution to permeability is highly dependent on their connectivity through the interparticle pore network or associated fractures."
azimuth,"Azimuth is a horizontal angular measurement that quantifies the directional orientation of a geological feature or operational vector, expressed in degrees clockwise from a reference direction such as True North. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is a critical parameter used in seismic acquisition to image subsalt carbonate reservoirs and in reservoir characterization to define the orientation of fracture networks that control permeability. This characterization is essential for optimizing the trajectory of development wells."
carbonate ramp,"A carbonate ramp is a carbonate depositional system that is characterized by a gently dipping homoclinal slope extending from the shoreline into the basin without a significant break in slope. Within the lacustrine context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this depositional profile organizes facies belts controlled by lake-level energy and water chemistry. This geometry results in the formation of extensive, laterally continuous reservoir bodies composed of microbialites, spherulites, and coquinas."
composite log,"A composite log is a consolidated graphical display that integrates multiple wellbore datasets, including wireline logs, lithological descriptions, and petrophysical interpretations, against a common depth scale.

This process encompasses both primary migration, the expulsion from the source rock matrix, and secondary migration, the subsequent movement through permeable carrier beds and fault conduits. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this typically involves the vertical and lateral movement of oil and gas from lacustrine source rocks to charge the overlying microbial and coquina carbonate reservoirs."
hydrocarbon production,"Hydrocarbon production is a process that comprises the extraction of reservoir fluids, primarily oil and associated gas often rich in carbon dioxide, from subsurface accumulations through a system of wells and subsea infrastructure to a processing facility. At the facility, these fluids are separated, treated to specification, and prepared for export. This phase also includes the management of produced water and the reinjection of gas for reservoir pressure maintenance or carbon capture."

This thermal anomaly is a critical element for the maturation of the lacustrine source rocks within the Pre-Salt petroleum system."
marine transgression,"A marine transgression is a geological event that involves the landward migration of the shoreline due to a relative sea level rise, resulting in the deposition of a deepening-upward succession where deeper marine facies overlie formerly subaerial or shallower marine environments. This process is fundamental to the Pre-Salt petroleum system, as it established the marine conditions necessary for the deposition of widespread source rocks and subsequent carbonate reservoirs over the continental rift sequence."
marl,"A marl is a fine-grained lacustrine sedimentary rock that is composed of a variable mixture of carbonate minerals, magnesium-rich clays, and fine-grained siliciclastics.

It comprises a genetically related succession of depositional systems or supersequences that records a complete first-order cycle of basin evolution. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these units define the fundamental framework controlling the distribution of the lacustrine source rocks and the overlying microbial carbonate reservoirs."
open marine condition,"An open marine condition is a paleoenvironmental setting that is characterized by a free and continuous connection to the global ocean. This setting promotes normal marine salinity and well-oxygenated water circulation, directly influencing sediment character and faunal assemblages. In the context of the South Atlantic, it contrasts with the restricted lacustrine to evaporitic settings that dominated the deposition of the Pre-Salt section."
reflectivity,"Reflectivity is a dimensionless seismic property that quantifies the proportion of incident acoustic energy reflected at a geological interface. This property is governed by the contrast in acoustic impedance between adjacent rock units. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, the high reflectivity generated at the interface between the overlying evaporites and the underlying carbonate reservoirs is the fundamental attribute for mapping the top of the reservoir."
shear zone,"A shear zone is a tabular zone of localized, non-coaxial strain that, in the context of the Brazilian continental margin, typically represents the reactivation of pre-existing basement weaknesses during the South Atlantic rifting. These structures fundamentally control the geometry of rift segments and the development of structural highs that serve as the locus for carbonate reservoir deposition. Consequently, they are critical elements of the Pre-Salt petroleum system, influencing reservoir distribution, quality, and compartmentalization."
stratified salt,"Stratified salt is an Aptian evaporite sequence that is characterized by the internal, mechanically heterogeneous layering of a dominant halite body with interbeds of anhydrite, tachyhydrite, and carnallite. This internal architecture produces strong seismic reflectivity and governs the complex rheological behavior that drives salt tectonics in the Brazilian Pre-Salt. The compositional layering also presents significant geomechanical challenges for wellbore stability during drilling operations."

This unit encompasses the primary petroleum system elements, including the sag-like deposition of the main source rocks and the overlying microbial and coquina carbonate reservoirs."
agitation,"Agitation is a depositional process that describes the kinetic energy level within a water body, primarily driven by wave and current action. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt's saline lacustrine systems, this process directly controls the precipitation, morphology, and sorting of non-skeletal carbonate grains such as spherulites and coated grains. Consequently, the degree of agitation is a fundamental factor in determining the depositional fabric and the distribution of high-energy reservoir facies."
botryoidal chalcedony,"Botryoidal chalcedony is a diagenetic silica cement that is characterized by a morphology of globular, radially fibrous aggregates. Within Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, it precipitates from silica-rich lacustrine fluids, commonly within the interparticle and vuggy porosity of Aptian carbonates.

It constitutes a direct geological sample essential for the lithological and geochemical characterization of drilled intervals. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, cuttings are fundamental for identifying complex carbonate facies and detecting hydrocarbon shows in the reservoir section."
detrital clay,"Detrital clay is a siliciclastic component that consists of clay-sized phyllosilicate minerals transported from a terrigenous source area into the depositional basin. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this component is primarily sourced from the erosion of rift shoulders, and its presence within lacustrine carbonate facies significantly degrades reservoir quality by occluding pore space. It is distinguished from authigenic clay, which precipitates in-situ during diagenesis."
flooding event,"A flooding event is a stratigraphic event that marks a rapid, relative rise in lacustrine base level, causing the submergence of a previously established carbonate platform. This transgression shifts depositional facies landward and terminates a shallowing-upward cycle. The event is recognized in the rock record as a flooding surface, which may separate reservoir-quality microbialites from overlying fine-grained, organic-rich source or seal facies."
flow rate,"Flow rate is a dynamic reservoir property measure that quantifies the volume of fluid passing through a specific cross-sectional area per unit of time. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, it specifically refers to the volume of hydrocarbons and water moving through the complex pore network of carbonate reservoirs or a wellbore. This measure is essential for evaluating well deliverability and characterizing the hydraulic connectivity of reservoir facies like microbialites and coquinas."

In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt reservoirs, the preservation of this porosity from early cementation is a fundamental control on reservoir quality and permeability."
isotopic fractionation,"Isotopic fractionation is a process that results in the relative partitioning of isotopes of an element between different substances or phases due to their mass-dependent differences in physicochemical properties. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this process is fundamental for interpreting the complex diagenetic history of lacustrine carbonate reservoirs by tracing the origin and temperature of formative fluids. It is also critical for determining the genesis of associated gases, such as CO₂, and for correlating hydrocarbons to their sag-phase source rocks."
lake floor,"A lake floor is a subaqueous depositional surface that, within the Aptian sag basins of the South Atlantic, constituted the bottom of a stratified alkaline lacustrine system.

This body of water was characterized by elevated salinity and high alkalinity, a specific chemical condition that governed the precipitation of the microbial carbonate reservoirs. Its progressive evaporation ultimately led to the deposition of the thick, overlying evaporitic section that forms the regional seal."
muddy sediment,"A muddy sediment is a fine-grained unconsolidated sediment that, in the Brazilian Pre-Salt, is composed predominantly of clay- and silt-sized carbonate particles, often of microbial origin. This material is characteristic of low-energy lacustrine depositional environments. It constitutes the primary matrix for organic-rich source rocks and forms low-permeability intervals that influence reservoir quality."
regional subsidence,"Regional subsidence is a large-scale geodynamic process that involves the long-term, downward movement of a broad area of the Earth's lithosphere. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is primarily driven by post-rift thermal contraction and isostatic loading from the thick sag basin succession. This subsidence created the critical accommodation space required for the deposition of the Aptian petroleum system, including the microbial carbonate reservoirs and the overlying regional salt seal."
sag interval,"A sag interval is a tectono-stratigraphic unit that is deposited during the post-rift, pre-drift phase of basin evolution, driven by broad thermal subsidence.

It is stratigraphically positioned between the underlying syn-rift sequence and the overlying regional Aptian salt seal, forming the core components of the play."
sand,"Sand is a clastic sedimentary particle that is defined by a grain diameter ranging from 62.5 micrometers to 2 millimeters. In the context of Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum systems, these particles are predominantly of carbonate composition, such as bioclasts or ooids, rather than siliciclastic quartz. The accumulation of these sand-sized grains in high-energy depositional environments forms the grainstone and packstone facies that constitute the most significant high-quality reservoirs."
seawater,"Seawater is an aqueous solution that functioned as the primary depositional and early diagenetic fluid during the formation of the Aptian carbonate reservoirs in the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Its characteristically alkaline and saline-to-hypersaline geochemistry was the principal control on the precipitation of the non-skeletal, microbially-influenced carbonates that constitute these reservoirs. This fluid is the precursor to the connate formation brines found within the petroleum system."

Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is fundamental in controlling the sorting, fabric, and geometry of reservoir facies like coquinas and grainstones. The resulting depositional architecture directly influences reservoir quality and heterogeneity."
basement structure,"A basement structure is a large-scale tectonic feature, such as a horst or graben, formed within the Precambrian crystalline crust by Mesozoic rifting processes. This inherited structural relief created the fundamental paleotopography that controlled the depositional architecture of Pre-Salt source rocks and microbial carbonate reservoirs. These structural highs ultimately form the primary trapping mechanism for major hydrocarbon accumulations."
drift supersequence,"A drift supersequence is a tectono-stratigraphic supersequence that comprises the entire sedimentary succession deposited during the post-rift thermal subsidence phase of a passive margin. In the Brazilian South Atlantic, this unit is bounded at its base by the breakup unconformity and includes the Aptian salt, which provides the regional seal and critical overburden for the underlying Pre-Salt petroleum systems. It encompasses all overlying marine carbonate and clastic deposits up to the modern seafloor."
extension direction,"An extension direction is a principal horizontal stress orientation that is parallel to the minimum principal stress (σ3) and perpendicular to the strike of major normal faults within an extensional tectonic regime. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this orientation governed the development of the rift basins during the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. It is therefore a critical parameter for defining the structural grain of the basement, the geometry of syn-rift deposits, and the orientation of fracture systems within the carbonate reservoirs."

In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, it is the primary mechanism controlling the formation of rift structures, the creation of accommodation space for carbonate reservoirs, and the development of hydrocarbon migration pathways and traps. This activity can be continuous or episodic, influencing both syn-rift and post-rift depositional and deformational events."
fauna,"Fauna is a fossil assemblage of lacustrine animals that characterizes the Aptian successions of the Brazilian Pre-Salt. Dominated by microfossils such as ostracods and bivalves, this assemblage is the primary tool for high-resolution biostratigraphic correlation and paleoenvironmental reconstruction of the carbonate reservoir systems. Its composition and preservation state are critical indicators of water salinity, oxygenation, and energy levels during reservoir deposition."
inversion,"Inversion is a structural geology process that reverses the sense of slip on pre-existing extensional faults due to a change from a tensional to a compressional or transpressional stress regime. This reversal leads to the uplift and folding of the basin fill, transforming former grabens and half-grabens into structural highs. Within the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system, this process is critical for the formation of large-scale anticlines that serve as the primary traps for hydrocarbon accumulations."
karstification,"Karstification is a geological process that creates secondary porosity and permeability in soluble rocks through their dissolution by acidic fluids. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this process is predominantly driven by meteoric water during periods of subaerial exposure, generating a complex network of vugs, conduits, and cave systems within the carbonate reservoirs. This diagenetic overprint is a primary control on reservoir heterogeneity and the development of high-productivity 'super-k' flow units."
magmatic intrusion,"A magmatic intrusion is a body of igneous rock that results from the emplacement and subsequent crystallization of magma within a pre-existing sedimentary succession. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these are predominantly Cenozoic features that intrude the Aptian carbonate reservoir section. Their presence critically impacts the petroleum system by creating localized thermal anomalies that affect source rock maturation, altering reservoir properties through diagenesis, and acting as barriers that compartmentalize hydrocarbon accumulations."
normal displacement,"Normal displacement is the component of net slip measured parallel to the dip of a normal fault, where the hanging wall block has moved down relative to the footwall block. This displacement is the primary result of the extensional tectonic regime that formed the horst-and-graben structures fundamental to the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system. It creates the accommodation space for lacustrine source rocks and microbial carbonate reservoirs and can juxtapose these units against the regional salt seal."
post-rift stage,"The post-rift stage is a tectono-stratigraphic phase of basin evolution that commences after the cessation of active crustal extension and is primarily controlled by thermal subsidence. In the context of the South Atlantic margin, this stage encompasses the deposition of the Aptian sag section, which includes the Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs, and the overlying regional evaporitic seal. It is characterized by the development of a broad, thermally-driven sag basin architecture, contrasting with the preceding fault-bounded graben systems of the syn-rift."
pre-salt carbonate,"A pre-salt carbonate is a succession of carbonate rocks that was deposited in a late Barremian to early Aptian lacustrine rift system, stratigraphically preceding the deposition of the main Aptian salt layer in Brazil's marginal basins.

In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these include rock types such as dense, heavily cemented microbialites, argillaceous carbonates, and evaporitic layers. Such facies commonly function as seals or baffles, creating barriers to fluid flow and contributing to reservoir compartmentalization."
oil equivalent,"Oil equivalent is a metric that standardizes the quantity of various hydrocarbon types, primarily natural gas and condensates, into a single value based on the energy content of crude oil. This normalization allows for the consistent aggregation of reserves, resources, and production volumes from reservoirs containing multiple fluid phases, such as those found in the Brazilian Pre-Salt. The conversion is performed using a factor that equates the energy released upon combustion of a given volume of gas or condensate to that of a barrel of oil."

This model posits that mineral precipitation occurs without significant microbial mediation, contrasting directly with biotic interpretations."
antithetic fault,"An antithetic fault is a secondary normal fault that has a dip direction opposite to that of a larger, controlling master fault. In the context of the South Atlantic rift system, these structures commonly develop within the hanging wall of major listric normal faults that bound the Pre-Salt grabens. Their development contributes to the structural compartmentalization of sag-phase carbonate reservoirs and can create secondary hydrocarbon traps."
deepwater environment,"A deepwater environment is a marine or lacustrine depositional setting that exists below the effective wave base in a basinal position, where sedimentation is dominated by pelagic settling and gravity-driven processes.

closed lake,"A closed lake is a lacustrine depositional system that lacks significant outflow, where water loss is dominated by evaporation. This process concentrates dissolved solids, creating a stratified, alkaline, and often hypersaline water column essential for the Brazilian Pre-Salt petroleum system. This endorheic setting promotes the coeval deposition of organic-rich source rocks in anoxic bottom waters and the precipitation of microbial carbonates that form the primary reservoirs."
normal grading,"Normal grading is a primary sedimentary structure that is characterized by a progressive upward decrease in the mean size of constituent particles, such as spherulites or bioclasts, within a single depositional bed. This texture typically results from deposition during a single, waning-energy event, such as a storm-induced flow or a gravity-driven current common in the lacustrine Pre-Salt setting.

These crusts constitute a primary reservoir facies in the Brazilian Pre-Salt, where their preserved inter-fascicular porosity creates zones of high permeability."
hydrothermal,"A hydrothermal process is a geological process driven by the circulation of heated, chemically reactive aqueous fluids through crustal rocks. In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these fluids are typically magnesium-rich, heated by rift-related magmatism, and derive their solutes from the alteration of associated mafic and ultramafic rocks. This process is a primary control on the diagenesis and dolomitization that dictates the quality of the carbonate reservoirs."
water residence time,"Water residence time is a hydrogeological parameter that quantifies the average duration a water molecule remains within a defined depositional system, such as a lacustrine basin.

In the Brazilian Pre-Salt, its quality is predominantly governed by the complex geometry and high velocity of the overlying salt layer, which creates poorly imaged shadow zones over the target reservoirs. This attribute is therefore critical for assessing the confidence in seismic interpretations of sub-salt carbonate facies and for optimizing survey design."
chemical deposit,"A chemical deposit is a sedimentary rock that is formed by the inorganic precipitation of minerals, such as halite and anhydrite, from a hypersaline aqueous solution due to intense evaporation. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, these deposits constitute the extensive Aptian evaporite sequence.

oxygen stable isotope,"An oxygen stable isotope is a non-radioactive nuclide of oxygen whose abundance ratio in carbonate minerals serves as a geochemical proxy for the temperature and composition of formative fluids. In the context of the Brazilian Pre-Salt, this proxy is essential for reconstructing the paleo-salinity of depositional lacustrine environments and for tracing the diagenetic pathways that control reservoir quality. The analysis of this ratio, typically expressed as δ¹⁸O, helps to constrain the evolution of fluid-rock interaction from deposition through burial."
terminal splay deposit,"A terminal splay deposit is a lobate to fan-shaped siliciclastic sedimentary body that is formed by the deposition of sediment from unconfined, decelerating flows at the terminus of a distributive channel system prograding into a lacustrine basin.
